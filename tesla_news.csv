Apple Seeks Dismissal of U.S. Smartphone Monopoly Case,"Apple wants the dismissal of a case accusing it of illegally dominating the smartphone sector.

The company was set to go to court asking a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust suit, Reuters reported Wednesday (Nov. 20).

The DOJ has accused Apple of preventing competitors from accessing its devices’ software and hardware, thus making it tougher for consumers to switch phones.

“We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said soon after the suit was filed. “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.”

Apple has denied that it runs a monopoly, arguing in court this summer that it is not required to provide software developers with any more access to iPhones than they already get.

“The implausibility of the government’s claim that Apple’s conduct has eroded smartphone competition is underscored by the complaint’s implicit recognition that the smartphone market exhibits ongoing innovation and vigorous competition,” Apple’s filing said.

The case is one of several antitrust suits involving Big Tech companies, part of what the Reuters report describes as a “bipartisan trend,” as the case against Apple began during the first Trump administration, but was filed during the Biden presidency.

The past few years have seen a decision against Google, with a court finding that the company holds an online search monopoly. Amazon is dealing with a case involving its policies towards merchants and suppliers, and Meta is being accused of stifling competition.

But as Reuters noted, some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple suit have not gone the government’s way.

For example, federal Judge James Boasberg last week dismissed a claim by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that Meta’s Facebook had restricted third-party app developers’ access to the platform in order to retain its market dominance. However, the judge allowed the commission’s overall case against the social media giant to proceed.

Meanwhile, Apple said last week it plans to “vigorously” defend against a $3.8 billion class action filed by British consumer group Which?, which accuses the company of violating U.K. competition law, using its control of its operating systems to give iCloud services preferential treatment.

Apple countered by saying customers are not required to use iCloud or iCloud Backup to store files, with many using options like backing up to an external storage device or one of several other providers’ cloud storage options.",https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2024/apple-seeks-dismissal-of-u-s-smartphone-monopoly-case/?utm_source=snapi,"The DOJ has accused Apple of preventing competitors from accessing its devices’ software and hardware, thus making it tougher for consumers to switch phones.For example, federal Judge James Boasberg last week dismissed a claim by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that Meta’s Facebook had restricted third-party app developers’ access to the platform in order to retain its market dominance.Meanwhile, Apple said last week it plans to “vigorously” defend against a $3.8 billion class action filed by British consumer group Which?, which accuses the company of violating U.K. competition law, using its control of its operating systems to give iCloud services preferential treatment.",0.05384838581085205,0.08265241235494614,0.8634992241859436
Apple Urges Mac Users to Update After Hackers Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities,"Apple is recommending that Mac users update their systems after revealing that hackers had exploited two vulnerabilities in its software.

The company issued two bug fixes on Tuesday addressing issues in WebKit and JavaScriptCore, which power Safari and other web content. WebKit, in particular, is a major target for hackers aiming to exploit the engine to infiltrate devices and gain access to private data.

In the first instance, Apple said one issue stemmed from ""processing maliciously crafted web content,"" which can lead to an attacker running unauthorized code on a system. The problem was addressed through enhanced validation checks, according to Apple. The second issue involved a cross-site scripting attack. Apple said it resolved the vulnerability by improving cookie state management.

Apple says Mac users targeted in zero-day cyberattacks,"Apple released security updates on Tuesday that it says are “recommended for all users,” after fixing a pair of security bugs used in active cyberattacks targeting Mac users.

In a security advisory on its website, Apple said it was aware of two vulnerabilities that “may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” The bugs are considered “zero day” vulnerabilities because they were unknown to Apple at the time they were exploited.

To fix the bugs, Apple released a software update for macOS, as well as fixes for iPhones and iPads, including users running the older iOS 17 software.

It’s not yet known who is behind the attacks targeting Mac users, or how many Mac users have been targeted — or if any were successfully compromised. The vulnerabilities were reported by security researchers at Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed hacking and cyberattacks, suggesting that a government actor may be involved in the attacks. Government-backed cyberattacks sometimes involve the use of commercial phone spyware.

As for the bugs themselves, Apple said the vulnerabilities relate to WebKit and JavaScriptCore, the web engines that power the Safari browser and for running web content. WebKit is a frequent target of malicious hackers, who target the engine for vulnerabilities as a way to break into the device’s wider software and tap into the user’s private data.

The security advisory says the bugs can be exploited by tricking vulnerable Apple devices into processing maliciously crafted web content, such as a website or email, to trigger arbitrary code execution, which can allow the planting of malware on a target’s device.

Users should update their iPhones, iPads, and Macs as soon as possible.

Google's antitrust loss could cost Apple billions of dollars,"Advertisement

Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on iPhones.

Those payments were at the heart of a federal antitrust case Google lost earlier this year.

Now, the government will ask a judge to ban those payments. But it's not a done deal.

Apple makes billions of dollars a year from Google. But a federal judge's ruling could make that money disappear.

That's because a long-running deal between Apple and Google, where Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine on iPhones, is at the heart of the US government's antitrust case against Google. And Google lost that case earlier this year when Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly in search.

Advertisement

On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice is expected to unveil a list of steps it wants Mehta to take to punish Google. Among the remedies the DOJ is asking for, per The Wall Street Journal: forcing the company ""to stop paying partners such as Apple billions of dollars a year to make Google's search engine the default on web browsers.""

Which makes sense, since that was a big focus of the government's case. (Though, confusingly, an earlier report from Bloomberg said the DOJ's plan focused on forcing Google to sell off its Chrome browser and never mentioned the Apple payments.)

In any case: If Google really is prevented from paying Apple, that could be meaningful for Apple's efforts to make money from services, which have become increasingly important to the company as iPhone sales flatten.

But even if that happens, it doesn't mean Apple automatically loses all the money Google pays it every year. It's possible that another provider, like Microsoft's Bing, could step in to make its own payments to Apple for the same prime real estate.

And while the DOJ's request and Mehta's eventual ruling are all important, they're not the end of the story. Google has said it will appeal the ruling. I asked Google and Apple for comment.

One more complexifier: How will the incoming Trump administration treat this case?

On the one hand: Donald Trump's first administration filed the original antitrust complaint against Google, and there are lots of people in Trump's orbit who are upset with Big Tech.

On the other hand: Trump has a record of selective enforcement, and Apple CEO Tim Cook built a rapport with him during the first go-round — which helped Cook persuade Trump to exempt Apple products from China tariffs.

Apple is revisiting a scrapped idea from its Steve Jobs era,"Advertisement

Apple is reportedly considering developing its own television set.

Steve Jobs had apparently had mixed feelings about Apple entering the TV market before his death.

Apple is also reportedly exploring smart home devices with AI assistants and wall-mounted tablets.

Apple cofounder Steve Jobs reportedly made it clear before he died that Apple wouldn't pursue its own television set, but the company may now be revisiting the idea over a decade later.

Although Apple hasn't made any announcements about a TV set, Bloomberg reported that the tech giant is evaluating the concept. That comes as Apple is said to be exploring smart home devices like a wall-mounted tablet or an AI assistant attached to a robotic arm as it looks to expand its offerings.

It's clear that the company is doing some soul-searching to find potential wins in multiple areas. Now that Apple Intelligence has launched, it can bring AI to new device lineups — including a home assistant or TV.

An Apple-branded TV set isn't new territory. It's an idea that its late founder and former CEO Jobs seemed to have a strong — and variable — opinion on.

Jobs reportedly told biographer Walter Isaacson that he'd ""finally cracked"" how to make TVs simpler to use. In his biography ""Steve Jobs,"" released in 2011, Isaacson wrote that the Apple founder wanted to make TVs more elegant and transform them the same way Apple had done for phones and computers.

Still, it's reported that Jobs had qualms with the television until his last days at Apple. In 2014, writer and former Apple beat reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane wrote in her book, ""Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,"" that Jobs told top Apple employees in 2010 that the company wouldn't be making a TV set.

As it stands, the Apple TV we know now is a box and remote set that connects to a television to bring Apple apps and streaming services to a big screen.

Apple's services business, which includes Apple TV+ subscriptions, has boomed in recent quarters.

4 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (and 7 He's Selling),"It's no secret that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has been shedding stock and hoarding cash, but that doesn't mean the holding company's portfolio managers are done dipping a toe or two into some new names, and even adding a little exposure to others.

As previously reported, Warren Buffett is selling large chunks of his favorite stocks , such as Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Sure, everyone would like to know why, but then Warren Buffett didn't become one of the greatest investors of all time by telling people how to front run his trades.

What we do know is that Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of equities to the tune of $36 billion in the third quarter. Furthermore, the company halted stock buybacks in Q3 after repurchasing nearly $3 billion worth of BRK.B shares over the first half of the year. For context, Berkshire repurchased more than $9 billion worth of BRK.B stock in all of 2023.

As a result, Berkshire holds $320 billion in cash vs just $272 billion in equity investments. Put another way, Buffett owns more cash than stocks. If share prices should suffer a broad and steep decline, Berkshire Hathaway will have ample resources to be greedy when others are fearful.

But before we get into Berkshire's most recent buys and sells, it's important to know that Buffett has always run a highly concentrated portfolio. Excluding the company's Japanese brokerage stocks, Apple alone accounts for 26% of Berkshire's equity holdings, according to data from WhaleWisdom . (That's down from almost 50% a year ago.)

Furthermore, Berkshire's top five U.S. equity holdings comprise about two-thirds of its portfolio value, while the top 10 account for more than 80%.

As Buffett likes to say, diversification is for those who don't know what they're doing.

Also please note that Buffett himself is thought to handle the largest positions in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Buffett says his co-managers – Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is CEO of Geico – act independently. Buffettologists generally assume Berkshire's smaller buys and sells are the work of these colleagues.

Stocks Warren Buffett is buying

Berkshire Hathaway initiated two positions in the third quarter of 2024: Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Pool (POOL). The size of the new stakes suggests these were not Warren Buffett's picks, but let's take a brief look anyway.

Berkshire bought almost 1.3 million shares in Domino's Pizza during the third quarter, a stake worth $549.4 million as of September 30. With a weight of 0.21%, DPZ ranks as the 27th most material holding in Berkshire's U.S. equity portfolio.

Berkshire now owns 3.7% of DPZ common shares outstanding, making it the pizza chain's seventh-largest shareholder. Wall Street analysts, whom Buffett totally ignores, are likewise bullish on DPZ's prospects – at least over the next 12 months or so.

Of the 34 analysts covering DPZ surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 18 rate it at Strong Buy, four call it a Buy, 11 have it at Hold and one says Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with high conviction.

As for Pool, which describes itself as the largest distributor of supplies, equipment and machinery for swimming pools worldwide, Berkshire Hathaway initiated a stake of 404,057 shares worth $152.2 million as of the end of Q3.

POOL's weight of 0.06% makes it the 30th largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Suffice to say, this name won't be all that important to the conglomerate's overall results. Meanwhile, with an ownership stake of a little more than 1%, Berkshire is POOL's 21st largest shareholder.

As previously reported, Berkshire has been adding to its position in Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). The investment, which is thought to be handled by Ted Weschler, includes purchases of a tracking stock for Liberty Media (LLYVA), as well as the merger of Sirius XM and the tracking stock. (Happily, this means we can all forget about Liberty Sirius XM Group, Series A and Liberty Sirius XM Group, Series C.)

The bottom line is that BRK.B now holds 105.1 million shares in SIRI, bringing its weight in the portfolio up to 0.9% from 0.1%. The stake, worth $2.5 billion as of the end of Q3, further cements BRK.B's position as SIRI's largest shareholder, owning more than a third of its common stock outstanding.

Lastly, Berkshire upped its stake in Heico (HEI) by 5,445 shares. The position, worth $213.9 million, has a weight of less than 0.1% in BRK.B's stock portfolio.

Stocks Warren Buffett is selling

As is well known by now, Buffett has been selling Apple stock even though the iPhone maker remains his favorite name by far. He has also greatly pared back Berkshire Hathaway's exposure to Bank of America.

Whether these moves were made for tax purposes or regulatory reasons or because Buffett is calling a market top is not known.

Here's what market participants do know based on Berkshire Hathaway's Form 13F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14.

After a series of sales, Berkshire Hathaway holds an even 300,000 shares in Apple. At more than 26% of BRK.B's U.S. equity portfolio value, the iPhone maker remains Buffett's biggest single bet by far.

Buffett is also reducing exposure to BAC, by 23% in the third quarter alone. With a weighting of almost 12% – down from almost 15% three months ago – Bank of America is Berkshire's third largest holding. The stake was worth $32 billion as of the end of Q3.

Staying in the financial sector, Berkshire cut its stake in Capital One Financial (COF) by 7%, selling a total of 719,052 shares. With a 0.5% weight in the portfolio, COF remains Berkshire's 19th largest holding.

In other sales, Berkshire slashed its stake in Nu Holdings (NU) by nearly a fifth, and decreased its investment in Charter Communications (CHTR) by more than 26%.

Turning to the department of ""that didn't last long,"" Berkshire essentially exited its stake in Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a position it initiated earlier this year.

As for total exits, Berkshire sold off what remained of its stake in Floor & Decor Holdings (FND), a stock it first bought in the third quarter of 2021.",https://www.kiplinger.com/stocks-warren-buffett-is-buying-and-selling-berkshire-hathaway,"If share prices should suffer a broad and steep decline, Berkshire Hathaway will have ample resources to be greedy when others are fearful.But before we get into Berkshire's most recent buys and sells, it's important to know that Buffett has always run a highly concentrated portfolio.Wall Street analysts, whom Buffett totally ignores, are likewise bullish on DPZ's prospects – at least over the next 12 months or so.",2.2674295507840725e-07,0.9999991655349731,6.300608106357686e-07
Why Has Warren Buffett Been Selling So Much Stock?,"Key Takeaways Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continues to be a net seller of stocks, having offloaded a quarter of its stake in Apple in recent months, regulatory filings revealed Thursday.

The holding company added to its cash pile for a ninth consecutive quarter, bringing its cash on hand to a record level.

The stock market's total value has climbed to roughly double U.S. GDP, a ratio Buffett previously called ""playing with fire.""

Warren Buffett is stockpiling cash. His Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) holding company continued to sell more than it bought in the third quarter, including a quarter of its stake in Apple (AAPL), regulatory filings revealed Thursday.

Berkshire Hathaway cut its large stake in Apple to about $70 billion at the end of September from nearly $175 billion at the start of the year. The most recent selloff was suggested by Berkshire's third-quarter earnings report earlier this month, but had yet to be officially disclosed to the public. However, the iPhone maker still represents roughly a quarter of Berkshire's $266 billion equity portfolio.

Besides Apple, Berkshire sold roughly 235 million shares of Bank of America (BAC). This was largely known, as Berkshire was obligated to report its sales of BofA stock throughout the quarter since it owned more than 10% of the lender.

Berkshire's Cash Reaches Record Levels

The filings come after Berkshire Hathaway said earlier this month that its cash pile had swelled to a record $320.3 billion in the third quarter from $271.5 billion the prior quarter. Of that amount, $288 billion is invested in short-term Treasury bills. Berkshire has accumulated cash in each of the past nine quarters.

Investors watch Berkshire's cash hoard closely for its potential as ""dry powder."" One potential reason Buffett's keeping that powder dry: The ""Oracle of Omaha"" may not see much room for growth in the market.

The ratio of stock market capitalization-to-GDP, also known as the ""Buffett Indicator,"" is used to determine whether an overall market is undervalued or overvalued.

"Apple deletes US-funded RFE/RL news app from Russian App Store, news outlet says","Key Takeaways Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continues to be a net seller of stocks, having offloaded a quarter of its stake in Apple in recent months, regulatory filings revealed Thursday.

The holding company added to its cash pile for a ninth consecutive quarter, bringing its cash on hand to a record level.

The stock market's total value has climbed to roughly double U.S. GDP, a ratio Buffett previously called ""playing with fire.""

Warren Buffett is stockpiling cash. His Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) holding company continued to sell more than it bought in the third quarter, including a quarter of its stake in Apple (AAPL), regulatory filings revealed Thursday.

Berkshire Hathaway cut its large stake in Apple to about $70 billion at the end of September from nearly $175 billion at the start of the year. The most recent selloff was suggested by Berkshire's third-quarter earnings report earlier this month, but had yet to be officially disclosed to the public. However, the iPhone maker still represents roughly a quarter of Berkshire's $266 billion equity portfolio.

Besides Apple, Berkshire sold roughly 235 million shares of Bank of America (BAC). This was largely known, as Berkshire was obligated to report its sales of BofA stock throughout the quarter since it owned more than 10% of the lender.

Berkshire's Cash Reaches Record Levels

The filings come after Berkshire Hathaway said earlier this month that its cash pile had swelled to a record $320.3 billion in the third quarter from $271.5 billion the prior quarter. Of that amount, $288 billion is invested in short-term Treasury bills. Berkshire has accumulated cash in each of the past nine quarters.

Investors watch Berkshire's cash hoard closely for its potential as ""dry powder."" One potential reason Buffett's keeping that powder dry: The ""Oracle of Omaha"" may not see much room for growth in the market.

The ratio of stock market capitalization-to-GDP, also known as the ""Buffett Indicator,"" is used to determine whether an overall market is undervalued or overvalued. The stock market's total value hit a record high of $58.13 trillion on Monday, ""an unprecedented 198.1% of U.S. GDP last quarter,"" Business Insider wrote, citing Wilshire Indexes data.

How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Apple Inc. AAPL shares closed higher on Thursday despite an overall decline in the stock market.

Consumer group Which? has filed a £3 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaching UK competition law through its iCloud service.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK reduced stake in Apple from 400 million to 300 million shares. Thus, Berkshire has now cut its position in the Cupertino, California-based tech giant by over two-thirds since 2023's third quarter.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.44%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,369,320 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $273,864 or around 1,200 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Apple to ‘Vigorously’ Defend Against UK Consumer Class Action,"Apple said Thursday (Nov. 14) that it will “vigorously” defend against a class action filed by U.K. consumer group Which?

Which? said in a Thursday press release that it filed a £3 billion ($3.8 billion) legal claim against the tech giant on behalf of 40 million Apple customers in the U.K., alleging that the company’s practices around its iCloud storage service violate U.K. competition law.

The consumer group alleges that Apple does so by using its control of its operating systems to give iCloud preferential treatment, encouraging users to sign up for the service and making it difficult for them to use other providers, according to the release.

Which? also alleges that Apple has overcharged users for subscriptions to iCloud, per the release.

“By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off U.K. consumers without facing repercussions,” Which? CEO Anabel Hoult said in the release. “Taking this legal action means we can help consumers get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behavior in the future and create a better, more competitive market.”

Reached by PYMNTS, Apple said in a Thursday email that it will “vigorously” defend against the claim.

The company said in the email that customers are not required to use iCloud or iCloud Backup to store files; that many customers use other options like backing up to an external storage device or one of many other providers’ cloud storage options; and that Apple’s pricing is competitive with that of other cloud storage providers.

“Apple believes in providing our customers with choices,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our users are not required to use iCloud, and many rely on a wide range of third-party alternatives for data storage. In addition, we work hard to make data transfer as easy as possible — whether it’s to iCloud or another service.”

“We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anticompetitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise,” Apple added in its statement.

In an earlier, separate challenge in the U.K., the country’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) halted an antitrust investigation of Apple by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), saying the CMA had not complied with deadlines in the process.

The CMA’s investigation focused on the supply of mobile browsers and browser engines and the distribution of cloud gaming services through app stores on mobile devices in the U.K.",https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2024/apple-to-vigorously-defend-against-uk-consumer-group-class-action/?utm_source=snapi,"Apple said Thursday (Nov. 14) that it will “vigorously” defend against a class action filed by U.K. consumer group Which?Reached by PYMNTS, Apple said in a Thursday email that it will “vigorously” defend against the claim.“Our users are not required to use iCloud, and many rely on a wide range of third-party alternatives for data storage.",0.9988765120506287,0.00026488053845241666,0.000858652638271451
Apple's future product lineup is starting to come into focus,"Advertisement

Apple is exploring new headsets and smart-home devices to expand its lineup.

Its plans don't always work out; it scrapped a car project and faces weak demand for the Vision Pro.

Apple's future profits depend on the success of devices other than the iPhone.

Apple's possible future product lineup suggests the giant is entering a new era.

Many devices are reportedly in the works at the tech giant, and many of them are very different from its golden child, the iPhone. Apple followers including the Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman and the Taiwan-based supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have said it's exploring new headsets, smart-home devices, and more.

The tech industry has long speculated about Apple's next big thing. The answer may lie in the slate that people have been reporting on for the past several months.

Creating a hit product isn't easy. The company in February scrapped plans for a car, and its $3,500 Vision Pro has gotten mixed reviews in the months since its release. On Sunday, Gurman said Apple was focusing on smaller wins that could generate revenue on the same level as its iPads or wearable tech.

That requires Apple to tiptoe into new territory where competitors may already be making strides.

Bloomberg on Tuesday reported on a wall-mounted smart-home tablet in Apple's production lineup that could operate home appliances, use Apple Intelligence, and access Apple apps.

The report said the project, code-named J490, could come as early as March, a month before new Apple Intelligence features are expected to roll out.

Though smart-home tech isn't a cash cow for Big Tech, another futuristic smart-home device is said to be on Apple's radar: a tabletop robot with an iPad-like display and a robotic arm.

Analysts from Morningstar, Deepwater Asset Management, and EMARKETER were skeptical about the device's profitability — or the probability of its existence — when Business Insider asked them about it in August.

Meanwhile, Kuo, known for his often accurate Apple product predictions, said in early November that the tech giant had delayed production of a cheaper Vision Pro to ""beyond 2027"" and would move ahead with a Vision Pro with its M5 processor and Apple Intelligence for 2025.

In the wearables category, Apple is said to be exploring AR glasses — perhaps inspired by the prototype Orion glasses Meta showed off in September — though they're far from production stages. The Morningstar analyst William Kerwin previously suggested that smart glasses are likely Apple's ultimate eyewear goal.

Apple’s AI Smart Home Hub May Be Able to Order Groceries,"Apple’s reported upcoming artificial intelligence (AI)-powered display, launching as early as March, could shake up the connected device market by giving the tech giant its first central command center to drive eCommerce and smart home purchases through its ecosystem.

The move may signal Apple’s broader ambition to capture a larger share of the smart home market, as consumers seek centralized control of their connected devices and seamless ways to purchase through voice commands and touchscreen interfaces.

“AI-equipped smart home devices could become powerful marketing tools through personal data analysis,” Szymon Markiewicz, operational product owner at tech firm Tietoevry, told PYMNTS. “Companies could customize offers and ads even more precisely to individual user needs, potentially boosting sales.”

The PYMNTS “How We Will Pay” report reveals consumers are increasingly intertwined with their connected devices, multitasking throughout daily life. Data shows that 85% of people are highly connected, with over half using devices during breakfast, two-thirds while commuting, and a similar number leveraging them while caring for others.

Apple’s Home Screen?

According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s upcoming smart display will sport a 6-inch screen framed by thick bezels, complete with a built-in camera, rechargeable battery and speakers. The device can be wall-mounted or placed on a countertop using a stand with additional speakers. While it works independently, the initial setup requires an iPhone.

The report says the device will run a hybrid operating system combining elements of the Apple Watch interface and iPhone’s StandBy mode. It controls HomeKit devices, handles video calls, and responds to Siri and Apple Intelligence voice commands. The launch is expected as early as March, positioning it as a direct competitor to Amazon’s Echo Hub in the smart home market.

Smart home devices using AI have become a rapidly growing category, with recent products highlighting innovation in security, convenience, and connectivity. Google’s Nest cameras are receiving AI updates with advanced processing to improve home monitoring. Anker’s Eufy line introduced outdoor security lights that use facial recognition to differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar faces. And TP-Link’s Tapo released a smart video doorbell with AI detection and 24/7 recording, emphasizing the trend of AI-driven solutions enhancing everyday home experiences.

The Potential of More AI In Homes

Markiewicz said AI integration in smart home devices could simplify their use, especially for those less tech-savvy. Many devices require exact commands like “Set the bathroom temperature to 23 degrees” or “Turn on the main light in the living room” to function correctly.

“These systems rely on strict conditional logic, meaning even a small error or change in word order can lead to unrecognized commands,” he said. “With AI, however, future systems could be more flexible and better understand natural language instructions, making them far easier to operate. By learning user habits, AI could even set up automatic scenarios like ‘leaving home’ mode or ‘morning routine’ — tasks that now require manually scripting each desired action and its exceptions.”

As smart home technology continues evolving, industry leaders envision a more streamlined future. DeepBrain AI CFO Michael Jung told PYMNTS that AI-enabled home devices could transform household technology through unified system integration. This would mean fewer devices needed per home while making core functions more accessible to users.

“AI devices in-home can impact consumer decisions by organizing their needs,” he said. “Intelligence software can share a grocery list across devices and allow multiple users to make updates. Additionally, many AI devices have voice operations that can simplify the ordering and payment processes, reducing the need for a wallet or credit card. As an Apple device, Siri can also be used to assist with consumer decisions and provide context to consumer questions like ‘Do I need to buy more bread?’”",https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/apples-ai-powered-smart-home-hub-may-include-ecommerce-capabilities/?utm_source=snapi,"“AI-equipped smart home devices could become powerful marketing tools through personal data analysis,” Szymon Markiewicz, operational product owner at tech firm Tietoevry, told PYMNTS.“These systems rely on strict conditional logic, meaning even a small error or change in word order can lead to unrecognized commands,” he said.By learning user habits, AI could even set up automatic scenarios like ‘leaving home’ mode or ‘morning routine’ — tasks that now require manually scripting each desired action and its exceptions.”",0.9602213501930237,0.039608556777238846,0.00017007242422550917

Apple sued by Which? over iCloud use - with potential payout for 40 million UK customers,"Consumer rights group Which? is suing Apple for £3bn over the way it deploys the iCloud.

If the lawsuit succeeds, around 40 million Apple customers in the UK could be entitled to a payout.

The lawsuit claims Apple, which controls iOS operating systems, has breached UK competition law by giving its iCloud storage preferential treatment, effectively ""trapping"" customers with Apple devices into using it.

It also claims the company overcharged those customers by stifling competition.

The rights group alleges Apple encouraged users to sign up to iCloud for storage of photos, videos and other data while simultaneously making it difficult to use alternative providers.

Which? says Apple doesn't allow customers to store or back-up all of their phone's data with a third-party provider, arguing this violates competition law.

The consumer rights group says once iOS users have signed up to iCloud, they then have to pay for the service once their photos, notes, messages and other data go over the free 5GB limit.

""By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions,"" said Which?'s chief executive Anabel Hoult.

""Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.""

How much could UK Apple customers receive if lawsuit succeeds?

The lawsuit will represent all UK Apple customers that have used iCloud services since 1 October 2015 - any that don't want to be included will need to opt out.

However, if consumers live abroad but are otherwise eligible - for example because they lived in UK and used the iCloud but then moved away - they can also opt in.

The consumer rights group estimates that individual consumers could be owed an average of £70, depending on how long they have been paying for the services during that period.

Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in the US, where the US Department of Justice is accusing the company of locking down its iPhone ecosystem to build a monopoly.

Apple said the lawsuit is ""wrong on the facts and the law"" and that it will vigorously defend against it.

The lawsuit will represent all UK Apple customers that have used iCloud services since 1 October 2015 - any that don't want to be included will need to opt out.

However, if consumers live abroad but are otherwise eligible - for example because they lived in UK and used the iCloud but then moved away - they can also opt in.

The consumer rights group estimates that individual consumers could be owed an average of £70, depending on how long they have been paying for the services during that period.

Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in the US, where the US Department of Justice is accusing the company of locking down its iPhone ecosystem to build a monopoly.

Apple said the lawsuit is ""wrong on the facts and the law"" and that it will vigorously defend against it.

Big tech's battles

This is the latest in a line of challenges big tech companies like Apple, Google and Samsung have faced around anti-competitive practices.

Most notably, a landmark case in the US earlier this year saw a judge rule that Google holds an illegal monopoly over the internet search market.

The company is now facing a second antitrust lawsuit, and may be forced to break up parts of its business.

And in December last year, a judge declared Google's Android app store a monopoly in a case brought by a private gaming company.

""Now that five companies control the whole of the internet economy, there's a real need for people to fight back and to really put pressure on the government,"" William Fitzgerald, from tech campaigning organisation The Worker Agency, told Sky News.

Apple faces UK ‘iCloud monopoly’ compensation claim worth $3.8B,"U.K. consumer rights group ‘Which?’ is filing a legal claim against Apple under competition law on behalf of some 40 million users of iCloud, its cloud storage service.

The collective proceeding lawsuit, which is seeking £3 billion in compensation damages (around $3.8 billion at current exchange rates), alleges that Apple has broken competition rules by giving its own cloud storage service preferential treatment and effectively locking people into paying for iCloud at “rip-off” prices.

“iOS has a monopoly and is in control of Apple’s operating systems and it is incumbent on Apple not to use that dominance to gain an unfair advantage in related markets, like the cloud storage market. But that is exactly what has happened,” Which wrote in a press release announcing the filing of the claim with the U.K.’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).

The lawsuit accuses Apple of encouraging users of its devices to sign up for iCloud for photo storage and other data storage needs, while simultaneously making it difficult for consumers to use alternative storage providers — including by not allowing them to store or back up all of their phone’s data with a third-party provider.

“iOS users then have to pay for the service once photos, notes, messages and other data go over the free 5GB limit,” Which noted.

The suit also accuses Apple of overcharging U.K. consumers for iCloud subscriptions owing to the lack of competition. “Apple raised the price of iCloud for UK consumers by between 20% and 29% across its storage tiers in 2023,” it wrote, saying it’s seeking damages for all affected Apple customers — and estimating that individual consumers could be owed an average of £70 (around $90), depending on how long they’ve been paying Apple for iCloud services.

A similar lawsuit — arguing Apple unlawfully monopolized the market for cloud storage — was filed in the U.S. back in March and remains pending after the company failed to get it tossed.

Responding to the U.K. suit, Apple spokesman Tom Parker sent a statement in which the company wrote: “Apple believes in providing our customers with choices. Our users are not required to use iCloud, and many rely on a wide range of third-party alternatives for data storage. In addition, we work hard to make data transfer as easy as possible — whether its to iCloud or another service. We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anticompetitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise.”

Apple claims its pricing for iCloud is similar to that of other cloud storage providers. Many of Apple’s customers use alternative storage options, it also suggests, noting that nearly half its customers are not paying for iCloud+, either because they do not need extra storage or don’t want to use its paid service.



U.K.-based consumers opted in

The U.K. claim is being brought on an opt-out basis for U.K.-based consumers who are eligible to be included. Consumers who live outside the U.K. and believe they are eligible to be included must actively opt in to join the action.

Which spokesman Tommy Handley told us eligible Apple customers include “anyone who has ‘obtained’ iCloud services, including non-paying users, over the nine-year timeframe since the Consumer Rights Act came into force on October 1, 2015.

Handley also confirmed that the £3 billion compensation figure accounts for potential opt-outs, duplicates, and mortality.

Which is a nonprofit but the litigation is being funded by Litigation Capital Management (LCM), a major global litigation funder, which it says has committed to seeing the action through to the end.

At the same time, Which is urging Apple to resolve the claim without the need for litigation — by offering consumers their money back and opening up iOS to allow users “a real choice” for cloud services.

Commenting in a statement, Which’s chief executive Anabel Hoult said: “By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions. Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.”

Assuming Apple doesn’t seek to settle out of court, the next stage for the litigation will hinge on whether the CAT grants permission for Which to act as a class representative for consumers and allows the claim to proceed on a collective basis.

There has been an uptick in class action-style competition suits against Big Tech in recent years following a wave of antitrust enforcements on both sides of the Atlantic that’s still playing out in terms of full outcomes and business impact.

In the U.K., Apple has also been targeted in a class-action style antitrust suit brought on behalf of developers last year, in relation to App Store fees.

Also last year, a separate U.K. suit targeted Apple and Amazon alleging price collusion.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard, also sees the Trump administration and Musk's potential influence on its policies as positive for the space industry.

""I think there's definitely a risk-on, post-Trump-win rally that's being reflected in this industry,"" Sheppard told CNBC.

""It's only going to continue to proliferate because of national security, because of the Artemis program to get the U.S. astronauts back on the moon, because of Elon [Musk]'s ambitious goals of getting to Mars,"" Sheppard added.

""When space does well, Rocket Lab does well,"" he stated.

Another space stock, Planet Labs PBC PL is up more than 34% over the past month. Investors can also monitor the broader space sector through the Procure Space ETF UFO.

""Space has been one of the best outperformers in the market this year for a handful of these names,"" Sheppard said.

What Trump's return to the White House could mean for global bond yields,"Former US President Donald Trump arrives during a ""Get Out The Vote"" rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, US, on Saturday, March 2, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Donald Trump's U.S. election victory has ratcheted up concerns about higher prices, prompting strategists to rethink the outlook for global bond yields and currencies. It is widely thought that the president-elect's pledge to introduce tax cuts and steep tariffs could boost economic growth — but widen the fiscal deficit and refuel inflation. Trump's return to the White House is seen as likely to throw a wrench in the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle, potentially keeping an upward bias on Treasury yields. Bond yields tend to rise when market participants expect higher prices or a growing budget deficit. Alim Remtulla, chief foreign exchange strategist at EFG International, said it would be ""untenable"" for the Fed to continue with its easing plans while yields rise. ""Eventually, either the Fed has to pause rate cuts as the economy is no longer at risk of recession or the economy turns and yields implode as recession looms,"" Remtulla told CNBC via email. ""Trump's election advances both possibilities as a trade war and increased fiscal spending work at cross purposes,"" he added. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has risen sharply since Trump's election victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in early November, before paring gains in recent days. The 10-year Treasury yield traded more than 3 basis points higher at 4.4158% on Wednesday morning. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. One basis point equals 0.01%.

European bond market offers 'more compelling value'

""In Europe, there's been a slight reprieve on not-as-bad-as-expected data but also on the realization that Trump policies will take a quarter or two to enact,"" EFG International's Remtulla said. ""There's also a possibility that rhetoric out of the Trump campaign was for election purposes and that he'll govern closer to the status quo. This would also help the euro zone avoid recession and lift [the euro ],"" he added. Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, stood at 2.337% on Wednesday, marginally lower for the session. The yield on 2-year bunds, meanwhile, was up by around 1 basis point at 2.151%.

Shannon Kirwin, associate director of fixed income ratings at Morningstar, said a significant chunk of investors were hoping for European bonds to hold up ""fairly well"" in the coming years, while the euro is expected to weaken. ""Even before the U.S. election, the consensus among the bond fund managers I have spoken with was that the European bond market offered more compelling value than the U.S. market,"" Kirwin told CNBC via email. ""As a result, many managers had already positioned their portfolios to be slightly tilted towards European credit and away from US corporate bonds,"" she added.

In an effort to raise U.S. revenues, Trump has suggested he could impose a blanket 20% tariff on all goods imported into the country, with a tariff of up to 60% for Chinese products and one as high as 2,000% on vehicles built in Mexico. For the European Union, meanwhile, Trump has said the 27-nation bloc will pay a ""big price"" for not buying enough American exports. ""We're hearing managers in both markets say they prefer to keep a bit of powder dry — for example by going up in quality or choosing to own a bit more cash than usual — in order to be able to take advantage of potential volatility down the road,"" Kirwin added.

What about Asia?

Sameer Goel, global head of emerging markets research at Deutsche Bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Tuesday that the escalating risk of higher U.S. inflation under a second Trump presidency doesn't appear to have been priced in just yet. Asked how Trump 2.0 could impact Asian economies and regional currencies, Goel said it was likely to lead to widening inflation gaps between the U.S. and Asia, which could then trigger further currency weakness.

""I guess, as always, different strokes as far as individual central banks and countries are concerned but I think there are more crosscurrents than offsetting here because tariffs could well end up being a lot more disruptive and damaging on growth,"" Goel said. ""On the other hand, it could be inflationary depending upon where energy prices go or alternative issues like currency weakness, which could feed back in for some countries more than it would be for elsewhere,"" he added. For Asian currencies, analysts at MUFG said investors were yet to fully price in the potential scale of U.S. tariffs on China and elsewhere. A 60% tariff on Chinese products, for instance, would require a 10% to 12% depreciation of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, analysts at MUFG said in a research note published on Nov. 7. They warned the potential for tariff retaliation could make matters worse and there's also a risk of other countries raising tariffs on China products. Asian currencies with higher exposure to China were thought to be more vulnerable to Trump tariffs, analysts at MUFG said, citing the Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won.

Currency outlook

Strategists at Dutch bank ING said in a research note published earlier this month that there is a tendency in financial markets to do ""a lot of second-guessing"" over possible outcomes. ""Our advice is not to overthink it and instead take the firm view that the new administration's plans for looser fiscal and tighter immigration policy, when combined with relatively higher US rates and protectionism, all make a strong case for a dollar rally,"" strategists at ING said in a note published Nov. 13. ""Yes, the US economy may end up overheating — but 2025 should be the year when more air gets pumped into any potential dollar bubble,"" they added.

"Trump tariffs to push down U.S. growth 'a great deal' going into 2026, Morgan Stanley warns","Donald Trump's proposed tariffs will dent U.S. economic growth going into 2026, said Morgan Stanley's chief global economist Seth Carpenter.

President-elect Trump has stated that he intends to impose a blanket tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports, along with extra tariffs ranging from 60% to 100% on goods imported from China. During the September Presidential debate, he described this approach as a means to extract funds from competing countries.

There is also a question of when and how swiftly these tariffs get implemented. In the event that they are enacted all at once, they could result in a ""big negative shock"" to the economy, Carpenter told CNBC's Sri Jegarajah on the sidelines of Morgan Stanley's annual Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore.

Carpenter, who maintained Morgan Stanley's base case of these tariffs being spread over 2025, said they would lead to higher inflation.

""Then into 2026, we think growth starts to come down a great deal in the U.S. because of those tariffs and some of the other policies,"" he cautioned.

""Very clear, tariffs push up inflation. Very clear, tariffs are a drag on growth for the U.S., not just for the countries that the tariffs are put on,"" Carpenter added.

Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert noted that if the proposed tariffs are levied, especially on top of those already imposed by the Joe Biden administration, a slew of sectors including the automobile, consumer electronics, machinery, construction and retail space would see higher inflation.

Trump's proposed 60% tariff on Chinese goods, along with Biden's existing 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, will ""significantly impact"" the auto industry, while a universal 10% tariff on consumer electronics' imports would increase costs for companies such as Tesla, Microsoft and Apple, Malek said. These higher costs will will likely be passed along to consumers, he added.

Though the U.S. consumer price index climbed 2.6% in October compared to a year ago, slightly more than September's 2.4%, inflation has ebbed in the U.S. after years, and has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates.

Should sweeping tariffs be enacted, markets could price out interest rate cuts entirely for 2025, said Ben Emons, chief investment officer and founder of FedWatch Advisors, adding that tariffs could also ""restrain"" growth.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/trump-tariffs-to-push-down-us-growth-going-into-2026-morgan-stanley.html,"Donald Trump's proposed tariffs will dent U.S. economic growth going into 2026, said Morgan Stanley's chief global economist Seth Carpenter.During the September Presidential debate, he described this approach as a means to extract funds from competing countries.Carpenter, who maintained Morgan Stanley's base case of these tariffs being spread over 2025, said they would lead to higher inflation.",0.9981677532196045,0.00015241271466948092,0.0016797359567135572
"Charts suggest market could weather Trump tariff increases, Jim Cramer says","CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday said the charts suggest that fears about President-elect Donald Trump's intentions to implement major tariffs on imports won't affect the market just yet, and the impact of any actual tariffs will be lessened if the market remains bullish.

Cramer examined analysis by Jessica Inskip, director of investor research at StockBrokers.com.

""The charts ... suggest that tariffs had little impact on the market until they actually materialized during Trump's first term — all the saber-rattling beforehand didn't do much damage,"" he said. ""Even when the tariffs actually hit and the market sold off, we eventually erased those losses the moment that the Fed stopped raising interest rates. ... I think she's got a real good point.""

To explain Inskip's analysis, Cramer reviewed charts of the S&P 500 's performance, including one from mid-2017 to 2020, reviewing how the index behaved during Trump's previous term when he raised tariffs on a variety of goods including steel, aluminum and solar panels. The lead-up to the tariffs didn't have a huge impact on stocks, he suggested. But the broader market reacted when Trump actually imposed them, balking at the idea that he had ignited a global trade war, Cramer added.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/cramer-charts-suggest-market-could-weather-trump-tariff-increases.html,"Cramer examined analysis by Jessica Inskip, director of investor research at StockBrokers.com.To explain Inskip's analysis, Cramer reviewed charts of the S&P 500 's performance, including one from mid-2017 to 2020, reviewing how the index behaved during Trump's previous term when he raised tariffs on a variety of goods including steel, aluminum and solar panels.But the broader market reacted when Trump actually imposed them, balking at the idea that he had ignited a global trade war, Cramer added.",0.9999804496765137,4.384379508337588e-07,1.904321470647119e-05
The Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Key takeaways:

Most dividend-paying companies issue payouts to shareholders on a quarterly basis, but a handful of monthly dividend stocks create more stability for income investors by paying them 12 times a year.

Monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated across a few sectors, namely real estate investment trusts (REITs) and business development companies (BDCs).

Dynex Capital (DX) and Prospect Capital (PSEC) are two of the highest-yield monthly dividend stocks.

For all the changes we've experienced in recent years, some things remain regrettably the same. We all have bills to pay, and those bills generally come monthly. Whether it's your mortgage, your car payment or even your regular phone and utility bills, you're generally expected to pay every month.

While we're in our working years, that's not necessarily a problem, as paychecks generally come every two weeks. And even for those in retirement, Social Security and (if you're lucky enough to have one) pension payments also come on a regular monthly schedule. But unfortunately, it doesn't work that way in our investment portfolios.

And that's where monthly dividend stocks come into play.

Dividend stocks generally pay quarterly, and most bonds pay semiannually, or twice per year. This has a way of making portfolio income lumpy, as dividend and interest payments often come in clusters.

Well, monthly dividend stocks can help smooth out that income stream and better align your inflows with your outflows.

""We'd never recommend buying a stock purely because it has a monthly dividend,"" says Rachel Klinger, president of McCann Wealth Strategies, an investment adviser based in State College, Pennsylvania. ""But monthly dividend stocks can be a nice addition to a portfolio and can add a little regularity to an investor's income stream.""

Today, we're going to look at eight of the best monthly dividend stocks to buy.

You'll see some similarities across the selections. That's because monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated in a small handful of sectors such as real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and business development companies ( BDCs ). These sectors tend to be more income-focused than growth-focused and sport yields that are vastly higher than the market average.

But in a market where the yield on the S&P 500 is currently 1.2%, that's certainly welcome.

The list isn't particularly diversified, so it doesn't make a complete portfolio. In other words, you don't want to overload on monthly dividend stocks. But they do allow exposure to a handful of niche sectors that add some income stability, so take a look and see if any of these monthly payers align with your investment style.",https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/the-9-best-monthly-dividend-stocks-to-buy-right-now,"Monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated across a few sectors, namely real estate investment trusts (REITs) and business development companies (BDCs).While we're in our working years, that's not necessarily a problem, as paychecks generally come every two weeks.That's because monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated in a small handful of sectors such as real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and business development companies ( BDCs ).",0.9999929666519165,1.836653780173947e-07,6.818048404966248e-06

""We'd never recommend buying a stock purely because it has a monthly dividend,"" says Rachel Klinger, president of McCann Wealth Strategies, an investment adviser based in State College, Pennsylvania. ""But monthly dividend stocks can be a nice addition to a portfolio and can add a little regularity to an investor's income stream.""

Today, we're going to look at eight of the best monthly dividend stocks to buy.

You'll see some similarities across the selections. That's because monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated in a small handful of sectors such as real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and business development companies ( BDCs ). These sectors tend to be more income-focused than growth-focused and sport yields that are vastly higher than the market average.

But in a market where the yield on the S&P 500 is currently 1.2%, that's certainly welcome.

The list isn't particularly diversified, so it doesn't make a complete portfolio. In other words, you don't want to overload on monthly dividend stocks. But they do allow exposure to a handful of niche sectors that add some income stability, so take a look and see if any of these monthly payers align with your investment style.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-age-group-owns-79-of-stocks-and-equity-funds-why-thats-good-for-bonds-ece0f436,"Monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated across a few sectors, namely real estate investment trusts (REITs) and business development companies (BDCs).While we're in our working years, that's not necessarily a problem, as paychecks generally come every two weeks.That's because monthly dividend stocks tend to be concentrated in a small handful of sectors such as real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and business development companies ( BDCs ).",0.9999929666519165,1.836653780173947e-07,6.818048404966248e-06

How to Invest in Natron Energy Stock in 2024,"Clean, sustainable energy solutions — like wind and solar — do have some downsides.

One of the primary drawbacks is that they don't produce power consistently throughout the day.

However, energy storage systems solve this issue.

With these systems, excess energy can be stored during periods of high production (i.e., when it's windy or sunny) and released during periods where production is low. This ability is critical for providing a steady and reliable energy supply.

While many energy storage system solutions currently use lithium-ion batteries, Natron Energy specializes in sodium-ion batteries.

Keep reading to learn why this is important and how you can invest in Natron Energy.

What does Natron Energy do?

Unlike lithium — which is rare, expensive, and difficult to mine — sodium is abundant.

However, sodium-ion batteries have lower energy density than lithium, making them less suitable for applications where space and weight are critical (like electric vehicles and portable electronics).

That's why Natron Energy primarily sells its products to data centers, energy grids, and other industrial applications where the size and weight of the batteries are less of a concern.

For these uses, sodium-ion batteries are cheaper, safer, more easily recycled, and have longer lifespans than lithium batteries.

Given the recent rise in energy demand and the continuing shift for grids to use more renewable energy, Natron Energy may be in a prime position to capture a large portion of this market.

And despite it being a private company, you may be able to buy its stock.

Here's how.

Can you buy Natron Energy stock?

As mentioned above, Natron Energy is a private company.

It is not publicly traded and it does not have a stock symbol that you can look up and buy in your traditional brokerage account.

Still, if you qualify as an accredited investor, you can buy shares of its stock on Hiive.

Accreditation requirements To qualify as an accredited investor, you must meet one of the following criteria: Have an annual income of $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly.

Have a net worth that exceeds $1,000,000, excluding your main residence.

Be a qualifying financial professional.

Hiive is an investment marketplace where accredited investors can buy shares of pre-IPO companies.

Thousands of the most popular VC-backed companies (like SpaceX, OpenAI, and Stripe) are available on the platform, including Natron Energy:

At the time of writing, there are two listings of Natron Energy stock available for purchase.

On Hiive, each listing is created by a unique seller who sets their asking price and quantity of shares available. Sellers may be current or former employees, venture capital firms, or angel investors.

After a listing is created, buyers can view the listing, accept the seller's asking price as listed, or place bids. Buyers can also add companies to their watchlist and get notified of any new listings or transactions.

To see the current listings of Natron Energy, including the current share price and implied valuation, create a free account on Hiive with the button below:

Can retail investors buy Natron Energy stock?

Because of SEC regulations, Hiive is only available to accredited investors. Since Natron Energy is still a private company, there's no way for retail investors to invest in it.

That said, some public companies have invested in Natron Energy. Technically, by investing in these companies, you could get (very) indirect exposure to Natron Energy.

Chevron (CVX) invested an undisclosed amount in January 2019 to support the development of electric vehicle charging stations.

(LBRT), which provides hydraulic fracturing services for oil and natural gas exploration, invested an undisclosed amount in September 2022. Nabors Industries (NBR) invested $7 million in July 2022. Nabors provides drilling and drilling-related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells in the U.S. and internationally.

Other public investors include ABB Ltd (STO: ABB), a Swiss electrical equipment provider, and Mercuria (TYO: 7347), a Japanese fund manager.

Natron Energy has made no indication of a potential IPO. Still, if you're a retail investor, you're likely better off waiting for its public offering to invest.

You may also be interested in battery-focused ETFs like:

Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT)

(LIT) Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT)

(BATT) iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN)

Each of these funds will give you broad exposure to the battery technology industry, though these ETFs are largely invested in companies focused on lithium.

Who founded Natron Energy?

Natron Energy was founded in 2012 by Colin Wessels (who serves as co-CEO), expanding on the work he had been doing for his PhD thesis at Stanford.

In 2020, the company achieved a UL 1973 listing for its sodium-ion battery, allowing it to begin commercial shipments to customers.

In 2024, the company began operations at its first mass-scale factory in Holland, Michigan.

Four months later, in August, it announced the construction of a $1.4 billion gigafactory in North Carolina. The new factory will allow it to 40x its production capacity.

How much is Natron Energy worth?

Natron Energy has raised $308 million over 12 funding rounds.

The company's most recent rounds were the $35 million it raised in its Series D in July 2020 and the $189.33 million it raised in its Series F in January 2021.

Natron Energy has taken a non-traditional approach to raising capital, opting to receive funding sporadically from companies that also want to form strategic partnerships (like those listed above).

For this reason, there is no publicly available valuation figure for Natron Energy. Some estimate the company is worth ~$1 billion.

However, it has also received capital from traditional sources like venture capital firms, including NanoDimension, Khosla Ventures, Prelude Ventures, Catalus Capital, Fluxus Ventures, and Volta.

Additionally, the company has received support from government agencies like the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) in 2020 and the California Energy Commission in 2019.",https://stockanalysis.com/article/invest-in-natron-energy-stock/,"United Airlines (UAL) invested an undisclosed amount in November 2022 with hopes of electrifying its airport ground equipment (like pushback tractors) and other gate operations.(UAL) invested an undisclosed amount in November 2022 with hopes of electrifying its airport ground equipment (like pushback tractors) and other gate operations.Natron Energy was founded in 2012 by Colin Wessels (who serves as co-CEO), expanding on the work he had been doing for his PhD thesis at Stanford.",0.9999948740005493,3.879427367792232e-06,1.216947566717863e-06
Stock Market Performance Under Republicans vs Democrats,"While you may have a strong preference for one political party or another for any number of reasons, your investment portfolio doesn't need to be one of them.

The reality is that the stock market really doesn't care if there's a Republican or Democrat in the White House.

Here are a few charts that show the irrelevance of political administration on the stock market.

Stock market performance by political party

From 1871–2020, a 60/40 stock-bond portfolio performed nearly identically when Republicans or Democrats were in office:

Source: PersonalFinanceClub

This chart alone should quash any ideas you may have about only investing when your political party of choice is president.

But what about Congress? Does which party controls the Senate and House of Representatives change stock market returns?

Historically, the highest average annual returns have occurred during a divided Congress (where one party controls the Senate and the other party controls the House of Representatives).

Since 1950, a mix of a divided Congress and a Democratic president has resulted in the highest average annual returns:

Source: YCharts

While these results may indicate a slight preference for Democratic presidencies, the differences are negligible.

Furthermore, given that every combination has generated positive returns, there's no reason to change your investment strategy based on which party controls which branch of the government. You should stay invested regardless.

Stock market performance by president

As shown in the first chart above, the stock market has performed well irrespective of who's been in office.

Here's a look at the S&P's performance by president:

Source: YCharts

No matter which side of the aisle you typically stand on, you'll have a hard time drawing any significant partisan conclusions from this chart. In general, the market continued its upward trajectory, seemingly indifferent to who's in office.

This begs the question: how much does presidential policy actually affect the stock market?

The impact of policy on the stock market

The exact amount of impact any administration's policy has on the stock market is up for debate.

However, it's safe to say that policy has very limited control over unanticipated and uncontrollable events, which are often the biggest drivers of stock market performance.

For instance, President Bush became president shortly after the dot-com bubble burst and months before 9/11, both of which resulted in significant sell-offs, and both of which were not matters of policy.

While the Great Financial Crisis happened during his presidency, it's hard to know how much blame (if any) to assign to him. The GFC would likely have happened regardless of who was in office.

Meanwhile, President Obama's returns excelled because of the GFC, as he took office just before the market's bottom in 2010. Again, it's hard to say if this was just good timing or a result of policy decisions he made (like his spending package).

All this to say, while an administration's policy probably plays some role, it likely doesn't change how the stock market performs in the short run all that much.

In addition to a president's policy, there are many other factors that are constantly being weighed by hundreds of millions of market participants all over the world.

If the market seems indifferent to which political party is in office, it's probably because — for the most part — it is.

Elections and policy changes often lead to short-term fluctuations, both higher and lower, as investors respond to the news. For instance, the S&P was up ~2% on November 6, 2024, the day after Donald Trump won the election.

What about jobs and the economy?

An administration's policy may not have a 1:1 effect on the stock market, but certain policies do have a direct impact on the economy, which, in turn, can affect the stock market, especially in the long run.

Tax rates, social programs, tariffs, immigration policy, healthcare reform, and infrastructure investments are all highly debated policy issues that will have major effects on the economy following the 2024 election.

Job creation, employment, and GDP have been higher on average under Democratic administrations.

Here's a table of the differences:

Source: EPI Action

The data is pretty clear: many primary measures of economic growth have been better when the president was a Democrat.

Still, the matching of economic policy and real-time economic performance is far from perfect.

The president does not have total control over the economy and, given the size and complexity of the U.S. and global economies, it's difficult to clearly assign causality to one set of policies versus another.

There's also the problem of lag.

When a president passes a law, it may take years before the effects of that law trickle down through the economy, at which point the next candidate may already be in office (and be assigned the responsibility for its impact, good or bad).

Additionally, it could be argued that the sample size is too small. There have only been 14 presidents — 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans — since 1949, which may not be enough to produce statistically significant results.

However, one could also argue that the large role of chance should cut uniformly across presidential administrations.

In other words, the above table shouldn't be explained by saying Republicans have had all the bad luck and Democrats have had all the good luck.

In which case, the Democratic advantage in economic performance is hard to ignore.

The final word

You may be tempted to only be invested or make investment decisions depending on what political party is in the Oval Office.

But, historically speaking, you would have generated substantially higher returns by staying in the market regardless of who was in office.

Source: YCharts

The market doesn't care if there's a Republican or Democrat in the White House — it has performed well under both types of political administrations.

Therefore, as investors, we shouldn't allow our personal politics to interrupt our financial plans.

A (nonpartisan) buy-and-hold strategy wins out.

How to Invest in X (Twitter) Stock in 2024,"In April 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion.

After being listed for nine years on the NYSE (under the ticker symbol TWTR), the acquisition once again made Twitter a private company.*

*The deal closed in April 2022 but Twitter was not de-listed until October.

Musk financed the purchase with $26.4 billion of his own money, $7.1 billion from other investors (including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal), and $13 billion in debt from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (the total transaction cost was $46.5 billion).

Despite Twitter (which is now called X) no longer being publicly traded, there is a way to buy shares of its stock.

Can you buy X (Twitter) stock?

X (Twitter) is not a public company, so there's no way to buy its stock in your traditional brokerage account.

However, its shares are available on Hiive.

Hiive is an investment marketplace where accredited investors can buy shares of private companies from existing shareholders.

Accreditation requirements To qualify as an accredited investor, you must meet one of the following criteria: Have an annual income of $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly.

Have a net worth that exceeds $1,000,000, excluding your main residence.

Be a qualifying financial professional.

Accredited investors can invest in more than 2,000 venture-backed companies on Hiive, including each of Musk's privately held companies:

At the time of this writing, there are 5 live orders of X stock available:

X is currently trading for $42.01 per share.

Each listing on Hiive is made by an existing shareholder who may be a current or former employee, a venture capital firm, or an angel investor.

Each seller sets their own asking price and quantity of shares available. From there, accredited buyers can accept a seller's asking price as listed, place bids, or simply add a stock to their watchlist.

To see all the bids, asks, and recent transaction data for X (and every other company on Hiive), you can register for a free account with the button below:

Can retail investors buy X stock?

Unfortunately, since X is a private company, there's no way for retail investors to buy its stock.

Given the lofty price tag Musk paid to take the company private, it seems unlikely he would be willing to take the company public again any time soon. However, in an interview in May 2023, Musk was unwilling to close the door on that possibility.

Still, I don't expect this to become a reality anytime soon.

The ARK Venture Fund

Retail investors can get exposure to X via the ARK Venture Fund. The venture fund, run by Cathie Wood, purchased a small stake in the company shortly after it became private.

Today, X makes up just 0.66% of the fund's holdings, though Wood has been trying to increase her stake in the company.

Retail investors can invest in the ARK Venture Fund — which also owns stakes in SpaceX, Epic Games, and OpenAI — via SoFi. You can learn more about how to invest on this page.

Alternatives to X

While you may not be able to invest in X, you can invest in a few of its publicly traded competitors.

More on Musk's acquisition of Twitter (X)

Although the deal was announced and approved in April 2022, Twitter was not scheduled to be de-listed from the NYSE until October 27, 2022.

The transaction did not go smoothly.

After Musk and his team of investors submitted their tender offer to acquire Twitter, the company's board of directors initially responded to the offer by threatening to adopt a poison pill.

A poison pill is a corporate defense strategy that allows all shareholders, except the acquiring party, to buy additional shares of the company at a highly discounted price.

However, the strategy was never enacted, and shareholders ultimately approved the purchase.

Then, in May, Musk put the deal on hold due to the alleged number of spam accounts on the platform. Twitter responded with legal action to enforce the merger.

On October 4, Musk's lawyers said he would proceed with the original deal.

How has X performed under Musk's leadership?

At the time of the acquisition, Musk gave this statement:

""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated. I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."" — Elon Musk

However, the acquisition has not gone according to plan.

Twitter was already struggling financially when Musk bought it. Despite being founded in 2006 and being a public company since 2013, Twitter was still not profitable in 2022.

Musk planned to make it profitable.

Shortly after the transaction closed, Musk fired many top executives, laid off 50% of the company's staff, and launched a subscription service for $8/month.

There have been more reductions to the workforce since then. In total, Musk has fired roughly 75% of the staff since buying the company.

After being near breakeven in early 2023, revenue cratered a few months later.

In October 2023, 50 of its top 100 U.S. advertisers stopped advertising on Twitter (which had been rebranded as X in July 2023), citing concerns over brand safety and content moderation issues. The effects have been huge.

In Q2 2024, X generated just $114 million in revenue in the U.S., down 84% from the $661 it generated in Q2 2022.

The number of X users has also trended down in recent years, peaking at about 368 million monthly active users (MAUs) in 2022 and decreasing to about 353 million MAUs in 2023. 335 million MAUs is the number projected for 2024.

How much is X worth?

Elon Musk took X private at a valuation of $44 billion, roughly 38% higher than Twitter's closing price the day before the announcement.

As mentioned above, Cathie Wood's ARK Venture Fund owns a small stake in X. In July 2023, the fund marked down its X valuation by 47%. This implied a valuation of $23.32 billion.

In May 2023, Fidelity also marked down its X valuation to $15 billion, roughly ⅓ the valuation Musk paid for the company a little over a year earlier. This was the third time Fidelity had cut its valuation since the acquisition.

In August 2024, Fidelity marked down its stake again, valuing its original investment of $19.66 million at just $4.19 million — a reduction of 78.7%. If accurate, this implies X is worth just $9.37 billion.

Here's a look at how X's valuation has changed over time:

Should You Care About Stock Dividends?,"While many investors refuse to buy anything but dividend-paying stocks, the benefits are purely psychological.

Investors are no better off owning companies that pay dividends than they are owning companies that do not pay dividends.

Dividends are also irrelevant when it comes to determining which stocks may have strong future returns.

Here's why dividends are mostly irrelevant to your portfolio's total returns.

The Dividend Irrelevance Theory

The Dividend Irrelevance Theory was developed by Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani in 1961.

Both Miller and Modigliani were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 for their work in capital structures.

The theory states that whether or not a company pays dividends has no effect on its underlying market value or profitability.

In other words, dividends are irrelevant to expected returns. Instead, a company's ability to generate a profit and grow is what determines its market value.

Therefore, investors should be indifferent to whether a company pays dividends.

For proof of why this is true, let's look at what actually happens when a company pays a dividend.

The math behind dividends

If you have $10 in your right pocket and you take $1 from that pocket and move it to your left pocket, how much money do you have?

$10, of course.

Dividends work the same way.

Let's say you own one share of a $10 stock and it pays a dividend of $2 per share. That $2 came from the company's balance sheet and was added to yours.

Your on-hand cash increases by $2 but your stock's on-hand cash decreases by $2, which reduces the stock price by $2.

You before You after Stock price: $10 Stock price: $8 Cash: $0 Cash: $2

There has been no change to your net worth. Right pocket, left pocket.

This is the “irrelevance” of dividends.

Before I go any further, don't hear what I'm not saying: Dividends do matter. Dividends + Capital Gains = Total Return.

This is not a comment on dividend policy. Many companies should pay dividends (assuming they don't have a better way to allocate the capital).

If investing in dividend stocks helps you get excited about investing and contribute more than you otherwise would, more power to you. A solid investment strategy that you can stick to is better than an optimal one that you can't.

Dividend-paying stocks have outperformed historically, but paying dividends is not the causal factor. Here's what I'm saying: dividends are irrelevant to expected (future) returns.

Here's another example.

All else equal, let's say you buy 100 shares of Company A and I buy 100 shares of Company B. Both stocks trade for $20 per share. Here are our balance sheets:

You Me Share price: $20 Share price: $20 Investment: $2,000 Investment: $2,000 Cash: $0 Cash: $0

Now, let's say Company A issues a dividend of $1 per share and Company B does not. Here are our balance sheets after:

You Me Share price: $19 Share price: $20 Investment: $1,900 Investment: $2,000 Cash: $100 Cash: $0

Our personal wealth is the same.*

Every dollar a company pays in dividends lowers the value of the business by the exact amount of cash issued. Issuing $1 per share in dividends lowers the company's share price by exactly $1 per share.

When a stock you own pays you a dividend, your on-hand cash goes up but your investment goes down by the exact amount of the dividend issued.

Your net worth doesn't change. This is hard to see explicitly because stock prices are constantly fluctuating, but it happens.

But not only are dividends irrelevant to expected returns — they can also have adverse effects on your portfolio.

*It's worth noting that dividends are taxed differently. The tax rate could depend on the individual, so the ending value could be different for this reason. You can defer taxes to the long-term capital gains rate if you hold the stock long enough.

The hidden drawbacks of dividend investing

From an investor's perspective, there are four primary drawbacks to investing in dividend stocks:

Lower expected returns Tax inefficiency Lack of diversification Arbitrary changes in spending behavior

1. Lower expected returns

In a 2019 paper, researchers found that investors view dividends as free money (known as the Free Dividend Fallacy) and account for them differently than capital gains.

This makes dividend stocks seem more attractive and causes investors to pay higher prices than a rational investor otherwise would.

The paper found that when dividend stocks are in high demand, investors buying dividend-paying stocks reduce their expected returns by 2–4% per year.

2. Tax inefficiency

Dividend investors have no choice on when they're taxed — when they receive a dividend, they owe taxes.

On the other hand, by selling shares to generate portfolio income, investors can choose when and how much they will be taxed.

3. Lack of diversification

Since only about 40% of U.S. companies pay dividends and the majority of those are well-established, blue-chip companies, dividend investors tend to underweight small capitalization and other types of stocks.

4. Arbitrary changes in spending behavior

Another paper finds that personal spending is highly sensitive to dividend income, furthering the argument that investors treat capital gains and dividends differently.

Dividend investors change their spending habits arbitrarily based on how much dividend income they receive, not based on a financial plan.

The reality is that investors just really like dividends, which can result in them overpaying for stocks with dividends and consequently reducing their expected returns.

Further considerations

Focusing on stocks that pay dividends may also lower diversification, create unnecessary tax drag, and cause retirement spending decisions to be based on a company's dividend policy rather than adjusted to fit individual preferences.

You may be interested in reading pages 19–21 of Berkshire Hathaway's 2012 Shareholder Letter. In it, you'll find why Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger decided they'll never pay dividends.

Creating your own income

Many retirees and other income-focused investors like having the regular income that dividend stocks provide.

However, as covered above, dividends are not free money. A stock's price will fall by the exact amount of the dividend issued, leaving your personal wealth unchanged.

Therefore, if you own a stock that doesn't pay a dividend, you can manufacture your own dividend by selling shares of stock.

Let's go back to the example above where Company A issued $1 per share in dividends and Company B did not. Here were the resulting balance sheets:

You Me Share price: $19 Share price: $20 Shares owned: 100 Shares owned: 100 Investment: $1,900 Investment: $2,000 Cash: $100 Cash: $0

While our personal wealth is the same, you have $100 in cash and I do not.

To create $100 of income, I can sell five of my shares:

You Me Share price: $19 Share price: $20 Shares owned: 100 Shares owned: 95 Investment: $1,900 Investment: $1,900 Cash: $100 Cash: $100

Again, our personal wealth is unchanged.

Here's the bottom line: Investors should view receiving $1 as a dividend, which lowers the stock price by $1, the same as receiving $1 by selling shares.

And remember, while you had no control over the size or timing of your dividend payout, I was able to choose how many shares I sold and when.

The company's dividend policy is not dictating my spending.

The final word

I have nothing against dividends. Dividend stocks are not bad. You do not need to go out of your way to avoid owning them.

In fact, dividend-paying stocks often have some attractive characteristics — value, profitability, stability, and growth — which may lead to outsized returns and/or decreased volatility.

However, the point is that those characteristics exist irrespective of dividend policy.

The irrelevance of dividends simply means that dividend payments don't change a company's expected future returns.

Should You Avoid Investing at All-Time Highs?,"“Buy low, sell high.”

As it turns out, this advice may not be as good as you think.

Failing to invest at all-time highs can cause you to miss out on years of compounding by keeping you stuck on the sidelines and waiting for a pullback that never comes.

Furthermore, and a bit counterintuitively, investing at all-time highs may even be more profitable than investing on any other given day.

Here's everything you need to know about investing at market tops, and why you shouldn't fear investing at all-time highs.

The data and concepts in this article pertain to investing in the S&P 500 index, not individual stocks.

The market regularly hits all-time highs

After peaking on January 3, 2022, the market fell by -25.4% in a drawdown that lasted a little over two years:

Source: Koyfin

Many investors, expecting the market to go even lower, stayed on the sidelines and watched as the market clawed its way back from the low.

By January 2024, with the market back at all-time highs, these investors thought the opportunity to buy had passed completely.

However, after ending the bear market by setting a new high on January 19, 2024, the S&P is up an additional +20.64% (as of October 22, 2024):

Source: Koyfin

A bear market turned into all-time highs, which turned into more all-time highs. How common is this behavior?

Very common.

Here's a table showing the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year returns from new highs following a bear market:

Source: A Wealth of Common Sense

In almost every instance, new all-time highs after bear markets were followed by more all-time highs. The average 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year total returns following new highs are +16%, +27%, +59%, and +206%, respectively.

Since 1950, the S&P has charted over 1,450 new record highs, roughly 6.5% of trading days:

Source: Savant Wealth

Notice the clustering — new highs tend to occur consecutively and persistently. In other words, all-time highs tend to be followed by more all-time highs.

Given that companies are growing and becoming more profitable over time, this is exactly what we should expect from a healthy market. You should expect to see many new highs over your investing life cycle.

But what does this mean for returns? Is it a bad time to invest when markets are at new highs?

What are the returns when investing at all-time highs?

It turns out, average returns are better when investing at all-time highs.

Check out this chart from JP Morgan:

Source: JP Morgan

If you had invested in the S&P 500 on any given day between January 1988 and August 2020, your average total return a year later would have been +11.7%.

But, if you had only invested on the days when the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high, then your average total return after one year would have been +14.6%.

This trend holds true for 3-year returns (+39.1% vs +50.4%) and 5-year returns (+71.4% vs +78.9%).

If you're wondering how this is mathematically possible, it's because only investing on days that close at all-time highs causes you to miss many of the worst-performing days.

Why is investing at all-time highs so difficult?

This above data is completely counterintuitive.

Don't all-time highs signify the market has never been more expensive? Don't all-time highs mean we're due for a pullback? How can returns possibly be better when the market is at its highest?

One explanation for why returns are better from all-time highs is because of investor behavior.

Anchoring: We anchor to old prices. The S&P can't be worth $5,800 because it was only worth $4,200 a year ago. For this reason, most investors have a hard time buying at all-time highs, even when the underlying fundamentals support it.

For this reason, most investors have a hard time buying at all-time highs, even when the underlying fundamentals support it. Loss aversion: We hold onto losing stocks for too long, hoping they'll come back to our purchase price so we can sell them without losing money. On the flip side, we're quick to sell our winners and lock in profits.

On the flip side, we're quick to sell our winners and lock in profits. Value seeking: We always want to feel like we're getting a good deal — nobody wants to buy anything when it's at its highest price ever. Plus, oftentimes, we could have bought at a lower price and didn't, which makes buying today even more difficult.

We always want to feel like we're getting a good deal — nobody wants to buy anything when it's at its highest price ever. Plus, oftentimes, we could have bought at a lower price and didn't, which makes buying today even more difficult. Fear of big losses: Investing at all-time highs exposes us to the possibility of earning the lowest possible returns.



All of these cognitive biases work together to create a psychological barrier that keeps stock prices lower than fair market value when the market is at all-time highs.

In turn, this leads markets to slowly but continuously make new highs as more and more investors buy their way back into the market.

Should you worry about timing the market?

Additional data suggests that the question you're asking — “Should I invest when markets are at all-time highs?” (which is really a question about market timing) — is largely irrelevant.

Historically speaking, the difference between investing on the worst possible days (the highest point of each year) vs the best possible days (the lowest point of each year) isn't as significant as you might think.

Here's a chart that shows the difference in returns between perfect timing and the worst timing for the S&P between January 2000 and June 2023:

Source: Plante & Moran

Yes, although achieving the impossible task of investing at the best possible time each year does result in higher returns, the difference isn't that staggering.

And even if you had the incredibly unfortunate luck to invest on the worst possible day every year for 23 consecutive years, you still would have outperformed 3-month Treasuries by nearly 3x.

Still, buying at an all-time high exposes you to the possibility of buying at the very top. If this is a concern, it's useful to learn how rare market corrections from new highs have been.

How frequent are market corrections following all-time highs?

The charts below show how frequently the S&P 500 Index has been down 10% or more over various time periods following each of the 1,250+ all-time highs since 1950:

Source: RBC

Conclusions

1 year after reaching an all-time high, the S&P has been down 10% or more only 9% of the time.

3 years after reaching an all-time high, the S&P has been down 10% or more only 2% of the time.

5 years after reaching an all-time high, the S&P has never been down 10% or more.

Compared to the frequency of new highs, long-lasting market corrections are extremely rare.

The final word

Hopefully, this article has made you more comfortable with the idea of investing when the stock market is at or near all-time highs.

The data clearly shows all-time highs are common and are frequently followed by periods of strong performance and more record highs.

If you're a long-term investor, you should expect to see many new highs over the course of your lifetime.

"Bonds vs Bond Funds: Pros, Cons, and Key Differences","DFIP, a long-term inflation-protected bond fund, is down -15.72% since the end of 2021 (as of the date of publication):

So much for bonds being safe, right?

Because of charts like this, many financial advisors and investors recommend owning individual bonds rather than bond funds.

Their argument goes something like this: “You should own bonds directly, not bond funds, because bond funds can fall in value, but you can always hold a bond to maturity and get your money back.”

What they're saying isn't wrong, but it's also not right. After all, if this were the case, why would anyone own bond funds?

In this article, we'll examine this question in detail, looking at the pros and cons of both bonds and bond funds, as well as how they compare.

How bonds and bond funds work

The truth is that the above argument is a misconception.

Remember — similar to how mutual funds are portfolios of individual stocks — bond funds are simply portfolios of individual bonds.

They can't perform any differently than the sum of what they own.

Pricing

Bonds and bond funds give the illusion of being different because of their pricing:

Bond funds show NPV* and interest rates. Bond funds are marked to market every day. Their price movements (gains and losses) are explicit and show in your portfolio in real time.

Bond funds are marked to market every day. Their price movements (gains and losses) are explicit and show in your portfolio in real time. Individual bonds show face value and coupon rates.* Individual bonds do not show price movements in your portfolio (unless you look up the bond's quote in the secondary market). Most investors don't do this unless they want to sell the bond, so they never see gains or losses on their individual bond positions.

*NPV and coupon rates NPV Net present value (NPV) calculates the current value of future cash flows from a bond, discounted at a specific rate (usually the market interest rate). A positive NPV indicates the bond may be undervalued, while a negative NPV suggests it could be overvalued.

Coupon ratesCoupon rates refer to the annual interest rate paid by the bond issuer on the bond's face value. This rate determines the fixed interest payments that bondholders receive until the bond matures.

Example

Here's an example.

Let's say investor A buys a 10-year bond with a $1,000 face value and a $50 annual coupon. The duration is 8.1 years. On the same day, Investor B puts $1,000 in an 8.1-year-duration bond fund, which holds bonds of equivalent risk.

The next day, interest rates increase to 10%.

Nothing explicitly changes for Investor A. The bond still shows a face value of $1,000, though he could now only sell it for $692.77. He can hold the bond to maturity and receive $50 payments in years 1–9 and a $1,050 payment at the end of year 10.

Meanwhile, the bond fund was marked to market. Investor B is now holding $692.77 in his bond fund and showing a loss of $307.23, but the fund is now yielding 10%.

Assuming rates remain unchanged and both investors spend $50 a year of income, they will both have $1,050 in year 10.

So, what's the difference?

Implicit vs explicit losses

The losses are explicit with the bond fund and implicit with the individual bonds, but your total (coupon + price return) real (inflation-adjusted) return would be the same in either scenario.

This has to be true since the bond fund is made up of the individual bonds themselves.

Holding an individual bond until maturity can't turn a bad investment into a good one.

If you bought a 10-year bond that paid 5% interest before rates went up and held it to maturity, you would avoid seeing a loss on the principal but you'd earn below-market returns.

If you purchased a bond fund, you would see the loss on the principal but would be earning market returns.

Net-net, there is no difference.

Maturity

Proponents of buying individual bonds also say that another downside of bond funds is that they don't mature, while individual bonds do.

That's true. However, that's only true for individual bonds, not the portfolio of individual bonds an investor typically owns.

Investors in individual bonds usually reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds in new bonds, often through the use of a “laddered” portfolio.

In other words, their portfolio of individual bonds, each of which individually will eventually mature, never itself matures — precisely like bond funds.

So, should you buy individual bonds or shares of bond funds?

There are pros and cons to each.

Pros and cons of bonds

Here's a summary overviewing the pros and cons of owning bonds.

Pros

Predictability: When buying an individual bond, you lock in a fixed interest rate and know the exact yield to maturity (YTM). This allows you to plan for and control the timing and amount of your investment income.

You can build a custom portfolio of bonds based on income thresholds, maturity requirements, types of businesses, or any other factor. Predictable value at maturity: Assuming the bond isn't callable, you will receive the par value of the bond at maturity (barring default).

Cons

High capital requirements: Most bonds can only be purchased in $1,000 increments. You will need a certain amount of capital to achieve proper levels of diversification, which may be prohibitive for some investors.

Time: You will likely spend a few hours per month researching, constructing, and managing an individual bond portfolio.

Pros and cons of bond funds

And here's a brief overview of the pros and cons of owning bonds.

Pros

Diversification: The primary benefit of owning a bond fund is instant diversification to a range of bonds across various issuers, sectors, and maturity dates. Additionally, bond funds can have investment minimums as low as $1, making diversification simple even for small accounts.

Monthly income: Most bond funds pay a monthly dividend, which many investors prefer to the semiannual payments of individual bonds.

Most bond funds pay a monthly dividend, which many investors prefer to the semiannual payments of individual bonds. Minimal maintenance: Since bond funds have managers who decide which bonds to invest in to maintain their target durations and diversification, there is almost zero ongoing maintenance work for investors.

Cons

NPV fluctuations: As interest rates rise and fall, the NPVs of bond funds move accordingly. It's uncertain where the NPV will be in the future.

As interest rates rise and fall, the NPVs of bond funds move accordingly. It's uncertain where the NPV will be in the future. Tax consequences: Fund managers buy and sell bonds throughout the year, which can lead to capital gains distributions at the end of the year. These distributions are almost impossible to plan for from a tax standpoint.

Bonds vs bond funds

Here are some other differences between bonds and bond funds:

Individual bonds Bond funds Minimum investment Higher Lower Diversification Harder to achieve Easier to achieve Customization Yes No Complexity / time required Higher Lower Income frequency Typically semiannually Typically monthly Fees / costs Commissions when bought and sold Ongoing management fees Predictable market value at maturity Yes (barring default) No Option for automatic coupon reinvestment No Yes

The question of investing in bonds or bond funds really comes down to personal preference: which set of characteristics do you value more?

Final word

Before you make your decision, remember that you don't live life in a spreadsheet.

While your total real return will be the same with either individual bonds or bond funds, the way you experience those returns will be quite different.

As investors, we tend not to notice the effects of inflation and higher interest rates as much as the sharp pain when our investments lose money. This is especially true about the “stable” portion of our portfolios.

If seeing the NPV of your bond fund fluctuate makes you uncomfortable, bond funds may not be right for you.

As long as you don't mind the extra work of managing them (building ladders and maintaining diversification) and have enough money to invest, individual bonds may be the right choice.

The Truth About the Safe Withdrawal Rate,"The safe withdrawal rate is one of the most important — and often most misunderstood — components of retirement planning.

The safe withdrawal rate, or SWR for short, is the amount of money you can withdraw from your portfolio each year without running the risk of depleting your assets.

Investors preparing for retirement can use the SWR to calculate how much money they will need to accumulate before they can retire.

For example, if you want to withdraw $35,000 per year from your portfolio and your SWR is 3.5%, you will need to save $1,000,000 before retiring.

However, while the safe withdrawal rate is a useful concept, it has limitations.

Since your future returns and your retirement length are unknown, it's impossible to calculate your exact SWR. There is no precise answer, like 3.67% or 4.16%.

Instead, the answer to “What is a safe withdrawal rate?” is closer to “Around 4%, probably in the 3–6% range.” (I explain these numbers in more detail below.)

And since failure means running out of money in retirement, most investors choose a conservative SWR that's toward the bottom end of this range — e.g., 3.5%.

That said, the math also shows that the vast majority of retirees should be able to increase their withdrawal rate over time, to 4% or higher.

Here's everything you need to know about safe withdrawal rates and how to determine your own SWR.

Disclaimer: Anything written about the safe withdrawal rate uses past performance to simulate future returns. This is no guarantee of future results.

The 4% Rule

A commonly cited SWR is 4% — this is known as the 4% Rule — which stemmed from a study conducted by William Bengen.

The study concluded that investors could withdraw 4% of their investment portfolios each year (adjusted for inflation) with a ~95% chance of not running out of money.

However, the study made two large assumptions:

A 30-year retirement: The length of your retirement has a significant impact on the resulting SWR — the longer the retirement period, the lower the SWR (and vice versa). Using a 30-year retirement isn't a problem; you just need to be careful about extrapolating the results onto longer time periods (which has become common practice in early retirement communities). Investments in U.S. stocks and bonds: The main problem with this study is that it used a 50/50 stock-bond portfolio that was invested entirely in U.S. markets. Over the period studied, U.S. markets outperformed the global average by a wide margin. If Bengen would have used a globally diversified portfolio, the resulting SWR would have been lower.*

*Another study, which used returns based on a broad sample of developed markets, found the SWR may be closer to 2.26%. However, this study invested in 38 developed markets equally (not weighted based on market capitalization) which may have understated returns and lowered the SWR.

While only using U.S. return data in the study may have caused Bengen to overestimate the safe withdrawal rate, the math also shows that 4% may be an exceptionally safe withdrawal rate.

Here's the math behind safe withdrawal rates and where these numbers come from.

The math behind safe withdrawal rates

The underlying question of the SWR is this: ""How confident do you want to be that your money will last?""

In the now famous Trinity Study, researchers looked at U.S. stock and bond returns over various time periods (15, 20, 25, and 30 years) and various asset allocations (100% bonds to 100% stocks).

They then examined withdrawal rates from 3–12% to determine what percentage of the time the portfolio “survived” — i.e., showed an ending balance of > $0.

Here are the results:

Source: 2010 Ibbotson SBBI Classic Yearbook

This study* found a 30-year portfolio with a 50/50 stock-bond portfolio and a 4% withdrawal rate survived 96% of the time, confirming the research done four years earlier by William Bengen.

*This study also only used U.S. stock and bond data, and suffers from the same problem mentioned above — U.S. markets performed exceptionally well over this period and it may not accurately represent future returns.

But that wasn't all.

Not only did the portfolio survive 96% of the time, but it had a 90% chance of leaving more than 100% of the starting balance. Said another way, a retiree using the 4% rule finished with less than their original portfolio size just 10% of the time.

Furthermore, the portfolio finished the 30-year time horizon with more than double the starting principle nearly 70% of the time. The median wealth at the end — after taking 4% withdrawals adjusted for inflation — was almost 2.8x the starting balance.

In other words, based on this data, it's overwhelmingly more likely that a retiree will be able to increase their spending higher than 4% than it is that they will need to spend a fixed 4% for the duration of their retirement.

If that's the case, why can't the withdrawal rate be higher to begin with? Why does the success rate fall off so dramatically when increasing the withdrawal rate to 6%, 7%, or higher?

The answer: sequence of returns risk.

Sequence of returns risk (SORR)

At the time of the Trinity Study, financial advisors told clients that if their portfolio earned an average of 8% per year, that's also what they could spend without running out of money.

The problem, however, is that this thinking did not address the sequence of returns risk.

The sequence of returns risk (SORR) is when, despite yielding adequate average returns during retirement, a portfolio will run out of money if it generates below-average returns early in retirement.

Withdrawing a large chunk of change at this time can destroy a portfolio and make it impossible to recover when the good market years show up.

Here's an illustration with a $1,000,000 portfolio:

S&P returns Withdrawal Portfolio balance Year 0 $1,000,000 Year 1 -25% -$80,000 $670,000 Year 2 -10% -$80,000 $523,000 Year 3 0% -$80,000 $440,000 Year 4 35% -$80,000 $514,000 Year 5 40% -$80,000 $639,600

Despite an average return of 8% per year and withdrawing 8%, the portfolio has fallen by -36.04% in the first five years of retirement, a completely unsustainable path.

For this reason, SORR is often the largest risk to retirement spending.

Your portfolio needs to survive the first part of retirement, which means starting with a withdrawal rate low enough that your assets are not irreparably depleted if your retirement begins in a string of down years.

How long is the first part of retirement? About 10 years.

The importance of the first decade

In research that looked at the most important factors when it comes to portfolio longevity, it was found that the first 10 years of retirement matter the most.

“It turns out 10 years really is the ‘sweet spot' for sequence of returns risk,” the study describes. “A bad decade at the start of retirement is more predictive than 1-year returns and is also more predictive than 30-year returns.” — Michael Kitces.

So, if the first 10 years of retirement go well, meaning the market generates average or better returns and/or you start with a low withdrawal rate of 3–4%, you'll likely have plenty of money left after you die.

Or, you can increase your spending over time.

If your first decade goes poorly, meaning the market has an extended period of bad performance and/or your withdrawal rate is too high, you may deplete too much of your portfolio early on and may be on the path to running out of money.

Fortunately, there are steps you can take to insulate your portfolio from market volatility — such as the use of a flexible withdrawal strategy.

The Guyton-Klinger Strategy

A variable withdrawal plan adjusts the withdrawal rate according to the returns generated by the portfolio.

The Guyton-Klinger Strategy, a variable SWR system, uses “guardrails” for spending, meaning retirees change their withdrawal rates based on the performance of the market, like so:

In poor market conditions, the “Capital Preservation Rule” kicks in In strong market conditions, the “Prosperity Rule” kicks in

Let's say you have a plan to spend X dollars per year in retirement, but only a portion of that will go to necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. The rest of it will go to new cars, hobbies, vacations, and other discretionary categories.

Based on these portions, you can determine — after accounting for social security and other sources of income — how much you'll need from your portfolio just to cover the necessities.

If this number equates to 2.5%, you'll know you can cut back significantly if needed in the case of a market downturn, high inflation, or some unpredictable “Black Swan” event. This gives you the flexibility for when you need to preserve capital.

On the other hand, if the markets are performing well, you can safely increase your withdrawal rate and spend money you didn't plan to have when you began retirement.

You can get a cheat sheet of the Guyton-Klinger Strategy here and watch a video about it here.

A simple rule for safe withdrawal rates

While the Guyton-Klinger Strategy can help establish a rules-based system to follow, many retirees find it to be overly cumbersome and impractical.

Remember, the primary risk to your retirement strategy is SORR.

If you earn terrible returns in the first few years of retirement, you will need to stick to a number like 4% or less. On the other hand, if the stock market rallies for the first few years of your retirement, you may be able to spend 5% or 6% and be fine.

Here's a simple rule for retirement withdrawal rates: Start at something like 3.5% or 4% and adjust (probably higher) as you go.

Don't be fooled into thinking you need to stick with the same withdrawal rate for 30 years. You can adjust your spending to your income during your retirement years, just like you did in your working years.

Safe withdrawal rates for early retirement

To this point, this article has covered SWRs for 30-year retirements. But what about people retiring in their 30s and 40s with 50–60+ years of life left? How do SWRs change?

It turns out, not that much.

Research shows that increasing the time horizon from 30 years to 45 years reduces the safe withdrawal rate from 4.1% to 3.5%.

However, extending the time horizon beyond 45 years did not require any further reduction in SWR (again, based on U.S. returns data).

Why do longer time horizons not require lower SWRs? It goes back to the sequence of returns.

The researcher explains:

“Over long time horizons, even balanced portfolios generate returns significantly higher than 3.5% and, consequently, the primary constraint of safe withdrawal rates is just having a withdrawal rate low enough to survive an early 1–2 decade stretch of poor returns. If the withdrawal rate is low enough to survive the first two decades of bad returns, then eventually the good returns arrive, the client recovers and gets ahead, and adding more years to the time horizon is no longer a risk.” — Michael Kitces.

So 3.5% is the floor, no matter how long you expect your retirement to be.

Additionally, early retirees can choose to take higher withdrawal rates and take on more risk (lower survival rates) for several reasons:

Early retirees can easily go back to work

Early retirees can allocate more of their portfolios to stocks

Early retirees can be more flexible with their spending and live very cheaply

If you can accept a lower survival rate and are willing to be flexible if the need arises, you may be able to use a withdrawal rate of 4% or more.

The final word

There is a lot of information in this article.

Here's a quick summary: The safe withdrawal rate is a useful concept, but don't let it trick you into a false sense of precision. No amount of math will be able to predict the length of your retirement or the returns your portfolio will generate.

The 4% rule is very safe for a 30-year retirement. 3.5% is even safer.

The sequence of real returns, especially during the first decade of retirement, is very important.

You should not start with too high of a withdrawal rate, but odds are you will be able to increase your withdrawal rate over time.

After retirement, remain flexible and adjust spending every few years when necessary.

Personally, I will plan for and start at a withdrawal rate of 3.5%, then adjust as I go.",https://stockanalysis.com/article/safe-withdrawal-rate/,"*Another study, which used returns based on a broad sample of developed markets, found the SWR may be closer to 2.26%.However, this study invested in 38 developed markets equally (not weighted based on market capitalization) which may have understated returns and lowered the SWR.Fortunately, there are steps you can take to insulate your portfolio from market volatility — such as the use of a flexible withdrawal strategy.",0.8712077140808105,0.08004526793956757,0.04874705150723457
"I Tried The Motley Fool's ""Epic"" Service: Here's My Review","The Motley Fool made some big changes to its product suite.

Previously, the company offered over 40 distinct services, which created thousands of possible product and renewal combinations. This made the site challenging to navigate and created a messy experience for members.

To simplify its offerings, The Motley Fool has introduced a new product suite for all levels of investing.

Now, each product (other than the first) contains several of its former products. So, instead of having 40+ offerings from which to choose, there are only five.

Its Epic service — which includes stock picks and a host of other features — is one of the most popular, and I'd argue is also the best value.

Still, at $499/year, it certainly isn't for everyone.

I've been subscribed to a couple of The Motley Fool's products for the last few years, and decided to try out the new Epic product for myself.

Here's my review of what's included in the subscription, who it's best for, and who might want to choose another subscription.

Note: Besides Stock Advisor, there is no other way to access the individual products The Motley Fool offers. They are only available via the five services.

Motley Fool Epic review summary

Overall rating:

Service type: Stock-picking newsletters

Stock-picking newsletters Best for: Long-term investors with portfolios of $50,000+

Long-term investors with portfolios of $50,000+ Cost: $499/year (new members can get their first year for $300)

In my opinion, Epic is the best value out of the five services The Motley Fool now offers.

One step above The Motley Fool's entry-level service, Epic delivers five new stock picks each month. These are a mixture of growth, emerging technology, and dividend stocks.

However, Epic is not for everyone.

The main drawbacks are the cost and the size of portfolio you should have before subscribing to this tier. The Motley Fool suggests you have at least $50,000 to invest.

Personally, I think you can have a smaller portfolio, but you probably want to add at least $1,000 to it every month if you want to invest in all of the new picks.

If the subscription is too expensive or if your portfolio isn't big enough yet, you may be better off with a Stock Advisor subscription, which is one service down from Epic.

"How to Invest in Attentive, the AI-powered Marketing Platform","Attentive is a marketing platform that allows companies to send hyper-personalized discounts, product offerings, abandoned cart sequences, and more to their customers via text message and email.

The platform uses a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and its clients' first-party data to deliver 1:1 personalization at scale.

During Cyber Week 2023, 8,000 global businesses used Attentive's platform to send over 2.2 billion text messages, driving more than $1.8 billion in revenue for them.

The majority of the revenue driven by Attentive is accretive — meaning it wouldn't be generated without a service like this. For brands using Attentive, the product more than pays for itself.

Attentive's effectiveness and obvious value proposition make it an attractive company to invest in. To date, it has raised $863 million from the private equity market, most recently at a $6.97 billion valuation.

Can you buy Attentive stock?

Attentive is a private company, which means there's no Attentive stock symbol and no way to buy the company in your traditional brokerage account.

However, if you're an accredited investor, you can buy shares on Hiive.

Accreditation requirements To qualify as an accredited investor, you must meet one of the following criteria: Have an annual income of $200,000 individually or $300,000 jointly.

Have a net worth that exceeds $1,000,000, excluding your main residence.

Be a qualifying financial professional.

Hiive is an investment platform where accredited investors can buy shares of private, VC-backed, pre-IPO companies. In all, there are more than 2,000 private companies with shares available on Hiive, including Attentive.

Attentive is part of the Hiive50, a collection of the 50 most active securities on the platform.

At the time of this writing, there are 40 live orders for Attentive stock:

On Hiive, Attentive's stock has an aggregate price of $6.88 per share.

Hiive is a two-sided marketplace — similar to a regular stock exchange — where buyers connect directly with sellers. Sellers are often employees, venture capitalists, or angel investors.

Each seller creates their own listing by setting an asking price and quantity of shares available.

Buyers can accept a seller's asking price as listed, place bids and negotiate with sellers, or simply add a company to their watchlist to keep track of any new listings or transactions.

Can retail investors buy Attentive stock?

Unfortunately, retail investors cannot invest in Attentive while it's a private company. You will have to wait for the company's IPO (more on this in the next section).

However, Attentive is not the only company in this space. You may be interested in investing in Klaviyo, which is one of Attentive's biggest competitors.

Like Attentive, Klaviyo (KVYO) offers an AI-based marketing platform that personalizes messages to potential and existing customers via email, SMS, and push notifications.

Klaviyo was founded in 2012, four years earlier than Attentive. It serves 151,000+ brands, which is almost 20x as many as Attentive. It became a public company in September 2023.

In the last twelve months, the company generated $809.6 million in revenue. It currently has a market capitalization of $8 billion and has a consensus “Buy” rating from Wall Street analysts.

While Klaviyo doesn't have the exact same product or solutions as Attentive, it is going after the same market with the same concept. If you're bullish on this segment of the market, buying Klaviyo stock may make sense.

Additionally, while they're not nearly as direct of competitors as Klaviyo, HubSpot (HUBS) and Salesforce (CRM) are both customer relationship management platforms that have begun offering AI-tailored marketing solutions.

Our #1 recommended brokerage If you want to buy these companies, you'll need a brokerage account. We recommend Public. For more information, check out our article on the best brokerage accounts in 2024.

Given their existing customer bases, they won't have to work as hard to get their products in front of potential customers.

That said, Klaviyo and Attentive are likely better, more focused solutions for D2C companies than HubSpot or Salesforce.

Twilio (TWLO) is also somewhat of a competitor, although its focus is on providing API offerings for programmable messaging.

When will Attentive have its IPO?

After Klaviyo went public in September 2023 at a valuation of over $9 billion, executives at Attentive told staff in an all-hands meeting that they were optimistic about their own public debut.

A few months earlier, in May, Amit Jhawar was promoted to CEO. In the press release announcing his promotion, the company wrote they were looking “towards the prospect of an IPO in the next 12–18 months.”

However, their tone shifted by October after Klaviyo, Arm (ARM), Instacart (CART), and Birkenstock (BIRK) had all fallen below their IPO prices.

The company then announced it no longer planned to go public between May and October of 2024. Jhawar said their plans to become a public company hadn't changed, just the timing of it.

The company has not released an updated timeline since then.

Who founded the company?

Attentive was founded in 2016 by Andrew Jones, Brian Long, and Ethan Lo. This isn't the first time the team has created a successful company.

They previously co-founded TapCommerce, an adtech company that helps businesses retarget ads to users based on their previous activity. It was acquired by Twitter for $100 million in 2014.

After working for Twitter for a couple of years, the team built Attentive in stealth mode for two years until it officially launched with a $13 million Series A in February 2018.

Today, the company has over 1,000 employees and has offices in New York City, San Francisco, London, and Sydney.

How much is Attentive worth?

Attentive has raised $863 million over eight rounds.

Investors include Bain Capital Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Eniac Ventures, IVP, Tiger Global, Base 10, D1 Capital Partners, Coatue, High Alpha, and NextView Ventures.

Their most recent round raised $470 million at a $6.97 billion valuation, which is triple the $2.2 billion valuation it earned in September 2020.

Goldman Sachs Head Predicts M&A ‘Pick-up’ in 2025,"Goldman Sachs Chairman David Solomon has reportedly predicted stronger capital raising under the next Trump administration.

Solomon also said Tuesday (Nov. 19) that there will be a more robust merger and acquisition (M&A) environment under the new president.

“Given where we are at the moment, … you’re starting to unleash some of those animal spirits, and you’re seeing a pick-up in equity activity, pick-up in M&A activity,” said Solomon, whose comments during the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit were reported by Reuters.

As noted here in September, this year, M&A activity in the U.S. has trailed other regions for much of the year. As of the end of that month, M&A volume in America was down 8%, but up 7% in Europe and 54% in the Asia-Pacific region.

Solomon’s predictions are in line with the way a number of industries have responded to Trump’s recapture of the White House earlier this month, as the Republican businessman is thought to be, well, good for business.

In the days after the election, banks and credit card issuers saw their share prices climb, as investors banked on the idea that spending will increase and defaults will drop under an improved economy.

Analysts also expect the new administration to be more likely than that of President Biden to OK Capital One’s plan to acquire Discover, or to alter — or simply jettison — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would lower credit card late fees to $8.

Experts also predict that Trump will roll back other Biden policies, such as the Justice Department’s efforts to break up Google, as well as merger review guidelines that were instituted in 2023 and policies implemented by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan aimed at addressing perceived harm from corporate consolidation.

The election has also seen bitcoin prices reach record highs on investor optimism that the Trump administration will mean a friendlier regulatory environment than the one offered by Biden, or what would have been offered under a President Harris.

Meanwhile, however, Walmart’s CFO said Tuesday that his company would likely have to increase prices on some products if Trump’s proposed tariffs become a reality.

Analysts also expect the new administration to be more likely than that of President Biden to OK Capital One’s plan to acquire Discover, or to alter — or simply jettison — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would lower credit card late fees to $8.

Experts also predict that Trump will roll back other Biden policies, such as the Justice Department’s efforts to break up Google, as well as merger review guidelines that were instituted in 2023 and policies implemented by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan aimed at addressing perceived harm from corporate consolidation.

The election has also seen bitcoin prices reach record highs on investor optimism that the Trump administration will mean a friendlier regulatory environment than the one offered by Biden, or what would have been offered under a President Harris.

Meanwhile, however, Walmart’s CFO said Tuesday that his company would likely have to increase prices on some products if Trump’s proposed tariffs become a reality.

“We never want to raise prices,” John David Rainey told CNBC. “Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.”

Rainey said it is too early to determine which items would cost more under the tariffs.",https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/kura-oncology-partner-with-kyowa-kirin-blood-cancer-therapy-2024-11-20/,"Goldman Sachs Chairman David Solomon has reportedly predicted stronger capital raising under the next Trump administration.“Given where we are at the moment, … you’re starting to unleash some of those animal spirits, and you’re seeing a pick-up in equity activity, pick-up in M&A activity,” said Solomon, whose comments during the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit were reported by Reuters.Rainey said it is too early to determine which items would cost more under the tariffs.",0.9506232142448425,0.048098184168338776,0.0012786549050360918

Nvidia's Data Center Revenue Hits Record High as Results Top Estimates,"Nvidia (NVDA) reported third-quarter results that beat analysts’ estimates on the top and bottom lines, though shares fell slightly in extended trading Wednesday as investors may have had higher expectations.

The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker saw third-quarter revenue nearly double year-over-year to a record $35.08 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income at $19.31 billion more than doubled from the year-ago period, also topping projections.

Nvidia's revenue gains came as data center revenue, a key figure for Nvidia’s AI ambitions, more than doubled to a record $30.8 billion.

The company forecast revenue of $37.5 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, above the analyst consensus of $36.9 billion.

Nvidia shares take fresh hit as growth expectations disappoint,"Nvidia, the chipmaker driving the boom in artificial intelligence (AI), has seen fresh falls in its share price following an earnings report amid continued supply chain constraints.

Its third quarter trading update showed demand for its top generative AI chips would continue to outstrip supply for at least a year.

Some would argue it is a nice problem to have but those curbs on revenue have been widely blamed for Nvidia failing to smash market expectations for revenues this year, holding back its performance.

Nvidia said revenues came in at just above $35bn over the three months - above the $33bn consensus, according to LSEG data.

The company, which has topped the rankings for the most valuable listed firm several times since late spring, has enjoyed an unprecedented increase in its share price, which began in earnest during 2023.

But despite shares performing well - they are up by 190% in the year to date and nine-fold over two years - they have endured more of a rocky ride over the second half of 2024.

That is because investors have fretted over the prospects for AI, competition to Nvidia and delays to its next generation Blackwell chips.

Nvidia values took a surprise fall despite bumper earnings figures for the first six months of its financial year and plunged further when widespread US market jitters set in at the beginning of September over the prospects for the US economy.

Fears that tech stocks were overvalued also contributed.

Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said on Wednesday of sales: ""The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing.

""Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell - in full production - are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference,"" he said of the chips.

Market analysts noted, ahead of the earnings update, that a positive share price reaction would depend on the revenue guidance not only being smashed but the outlook being broadened.

They also sought reassurance that Blackwell's rollout was seen to be on track to help justify the more recent share price recovery, one that tech has seen more generally since Donald Trump's US presidential election victory was declared.

Nvidia earnings: AI chip leader shows no signs of stopping mammoth growth,"The AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and the engine of the artificial-intelligence boom, rolled out another set of quarterly results on Wednesday to investors’ delight.

The company, whose value has soared by $2.2tn this year to $3.6tn on the back of near-doubling of chip sales, said it had revenue of $35.08bn, against expectations of $33.15bn. Its profits more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue surged 94% from the same quarter last year. The company projected that revenue would increase by 70% in the coming quarter.

Analysts anticipated Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share; the company reported $0.81. Shares of Nvidia fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement but soon recouped the losses to remain at a similar price; they previously closed at $145.89 in New York.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, who last week said he expected the computing power driving advances in generative AI to increase by “a millionfold” over the next decade, said in a press release: “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing.”

Soaring demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU chips appears to have quelled anxiety that the company could be hit by pullback in demand from tech giants sinking billions into AI processing and data centers.

Nvidia’s value has bounced back after a summer slump, rising 45% from an August low. The chip stock – up nearly 200% this year and up over 1,100% in the last two years – hit record highs following the election.

But many of Nvidia’s chip-making peers have become a net drag on the industry as they struggle to compete with its AI dominance.

Before the results were announced, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expected another “drop-the-mic performance” from Nvidia, saying it was “the only game in town with $1tn+ of AI cap-ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia’s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world”.

The world’s biggest tech companies have increased the amount they invest in AI by billions in recent quarters, positioning Nvidia as a major beneficiary.

Nvidia, which many see as a bellwether of the tech sector and artificial-intelligence demand that has helped power Wall Street to multiple record-highs this year.

But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, the threat of global tariff hikes from Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and the likelihood that US interest rates will not be cut by the Federal Reserve have also put markets on edge.

Other analysts agreed with Ives’ assessment that demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip could push Nvidia sales and market capitalization to new heights. Saxo chief investment strategist Charu Chanana wrote that signs of “extraordinary demand” for the new chip, including forecasts of record sales and reports of sold-out inventories for the next year, are strong indicators of Nvidia’s continued high performance.

But Chanana warned that “any signs of production delays or demand falling short could pressure the stock given its stretched valuation”.

Earlier this week, a report said that the chipmaker is having overheating issues with servers for its newest graphics chip, B200 & GB200 NVL72, both named for David Harold Blackwell, a prominent American mathematician and statistician.

Boeing gives lay off notices to nearly 700 in Missouri,"The AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and the engine of the artificial-intelligence boom, rolled out another set of quarterly results on Wednesday to investors’ delight.

The company, whose value has soared by $2.2tn this year to $3.6tn on the back of near-doubling of chip sales, said it had revenue of $35.08bn, against expectations of $33.15bn. Its profits more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue surged 94% from the same quarter last year. The company projected that revenue would increase by 70% in the coming quarter.

Analysts anticipated Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share; the company reported $0.81. Shares of Nvidia fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement but soon recouped the losses to remain at a similar price; they previously closed at $145.89 in New York.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, who last week said he expected the computing power driving advances in generative AI to increase by “a millionfold” over the next decade, said in a press release: “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing.”

Soaring demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU chips appears to have quelled anxiety that the company could be hit by pullback in demand from tech giants sinking billions into AI processing and data centers.

Nvidia’s value has bounced back after a summer slump, rising 45% from an August low. The chip stock – up nearly 200% this year and up over 1,100% in the last two years – hit record highs following the election.

But many of Nvidia’s chip-making peers have become a net drag on the industry as they struggle to compete with its AI dominance.

Before the results were announced, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expected another “drop-the-mic performance” from Nvidia, saying it was “the only game in town with $1tn+ of AI cap-ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia’s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world”.

The world’s biggest tech companies have increased the amount they invest in AI by billions in recent quarters, positioning Nvidia as a major beneficiary.

Nvidia, which many see as a bellwether of the tech sector and artificial-intelligence demand that has helped power Wall Street to multiple record-highs this year.

But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, the threat of global tariff hikes from Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and the likelihood that US interest rates will not be cut by the Federal Reserve have also put markets on edge.

Other analysts agreed with Ives’ assessment that demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip could push Nvidia sales and market capitalization to new heights. Saxo chief investment strategist Charu Chanana wrote that signs of “extraordinary demand” for the new chip, including forecasts of record sales and reports of sold-out inventories for the next year, are strong indicators of Nvidia’s continued high performance.
