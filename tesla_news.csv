外滙基金上季扭虧 勁賺1146億 股債滙投資齊報喜 展望今季正增長,外滙基金第三季度業績受多項利好因素帶動，季度投資收益1146億元，按年扭虧。美國和其他地區央行啟動減息，債息相應回落令債價回升，各地股市在第三季度表現亦向好，造就外滙基金各項投資類別在季內全數錄得正回報，為2023年第一季度以來首次。歸功環球減息 中港股市反彈金管局對未來表現的表述亦較以往樂觀，總裁余偉文昨日稱「盡量希望做到好成績」，副總裁李達志亦說「希望今季續保持正增長」。今年7月底公布外滙基金上半年表現時，余偉文曾稱，環球股市和資產估值已累積相當升幅，個別壞消息隨時令資產價格出現較大的波動和調整。回顧外滙基金第三季度表現，李達志指出，美債息在季內下跌，對該局持有的債價造成正面影響，而過去一年多各地央行加息後，則令債息收益增加；同時，9月內地和香港股市反彈，都利好外滙基金投資收益。由於美國聯儲局啟動減息，美元回落而非美貨幣回升，則帶動外滙變動損益在季內升81億元。余偉文提到，亞太區金融市場保持穩定，未受日圓套利交易平倉影響，內地新一輪政策措施有助鞏固經濟增長，股市氣氛改善，對經濟活動的正面作用將逐步浮現。第三季度，外滙基金繼續沿用投資組合收益的6年平均數，向財政儲備支付30億元，另向政府基金及法定組織支付38億元。余偉文：美大選或令市場波動首三季計，外滙基金累計進賬2247億元，以9月底止資產總值41339億元，投資回報率約5.4%，累計向財政儲備支付100億元，另向政府基金及法定組織支付122億元。9月底止，外滙基金累計盈餘按季增21.1%，至7825億元。展望後市，余偉文形容，第四季度有很多變數，宏觀環境方面，要觀察美國減息步伐會否有所改變。市場憧憬本周人大常委會會議將公布更多救市措施細則，余偉文認為，刺激措施是否能夠落地以至實際成效，都是一個變數，「將影響內地、香港以至亞洲股票表現」。同時，美國總統大選本周舉行，余偉文指出，選舉中間會否出現爭拗，對市場已經有大影響；投票完成後，對於競選人的政綱和其講話內容，市場反應亦會有很大變化。在美國大選有正式結果前，外滙基金將盡量提高防禦性，亦會保持靈活，希望可以機動調整部署。余偉文直言，美國經濟和政策前景存在不確定性，就業市場表現反覆，通脹有所回落，市場注視本周的美國大選，預期市場對各項經濟數據和政治風險高度敏感，呼籲投資者注意市場波動風險。另外，沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金（PIF）與金管局早前簽署諒解備忘錄，共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元（約78億港元）的新投資基金，推動和香港有聯繫的企業擴展業務至沙特。余偉文說，金管局和中東各央行一直緊密溝通，希望在金融基建及支付等方面能夠更加暢通，而中東在貿易及投資方面如能更多使用人民幣，香港作為離岸人民幣中心，將可提供相關流動性及投資出路。,
