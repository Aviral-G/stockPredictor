      "Summary: The National Labor Relations Board last week accused Apple of trying to prevent employees from discussing pay equity and pressuring an engineer who attempted to circulate a survey about wages to quit.\n",
      "Apple managers allegedly threatened other employees who posted on social media and in Slack and spoke to the media about workplace concerns, according to the complaint.\n",
      "I don’t regret standing up to Apple and I will continue to fight for the rights of laborers,\" Scarlett said.\n",
      "The NLRB is also looking to force Apple to reinstate Scarlett, compensate her for lost pay and issue an apology letter.\n",
      "The complaints by federal regulators highlight ongoing turmoil around organizing efforts by Apple employees both at the iPhone maker's corporate headquarters and at retail stores.\n"
